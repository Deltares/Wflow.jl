Compression increases computational time but can significantly reduce the size of the netCDF file. Set the compressionlevel variable to a value between 0 and 9. A setting of 0 means no compression, while values between 1 and 9 indicate increasing levels of compression (1: least compression, minimal run-time impact, 9: highest compression, maximum run-time impact).

See more details in the Output CSV section section. If a map is provided to extract data for specific locations (e.g. gauges) or areas (e.g. subcatchment), the netCDF location names are extracted from these maps. For a specific location (grid cell) a location is required. For layered model parameters and variables that have an extra layer dimension and are part of the vertical sbm concept, an internal layer index can be specified (an example is provided below). Similarly, for model parameters and variables that have an extra dimension classes and are part of the vertical FLEXTopo concept, the class name can be specified. If multiple layers or classes are desired, this can be specified in separate [[netcdf.variable]] entries. Note that the additional dimension should be specified when wflow is integrated with Delft-FEWS, for netCDF scalar data an extra dimension is not allowed by the importNetcdfActivity of the Delft-FEWS General Adapter. In the section Output CSV section, similar functionality is available for CSV. For integration with Delft-FEWS, it is recommended to write scalar data to netCDF format, as the General Adapter of Delft-FEWS can directly ingest data from netCDF files.

Delft-FEWS integrates data and models, and is for example used in many active flood forecasting systems around the world.\nThis can be done without a model adapter that provides the interface between Delft-FEWS and an external model (or module). This is possible because time information in the TOML configuration file is optional and Delft-FEWS can import and export netCDF files. When time information is left out from the TOML configuration file, the starttime, endtime and timestepsecs (timestep) of the run is extracted from the netCDF forcing file by wflow.\nTo indicate that a wflow model runs from Delft-FEWS, the following setting needs to be specified in the main section of the TOML configuration file:\nfews_run = true  # optional, default value is false\nThis ensures that wflow offsets the time handling, to meet the expectations of Delft-FEWS.\nIt also uses a different format for the log file such that each log message takes up only one line.

The intensity of soil erosion by rain or ﬂow depends on the land and soil characteristics such as slope, land use or soil type. Once soil is eroded, the detached particles can be transported downslope by overland ﬂow. Along the transport pathways, soil particles can also be deposited due to a low flow velocity, a change of topography in depressions, footslopes or valley bottoms, and/or can be filtered and stopped by a change in vegetation such as ﬁeld boundaries.\nThe inland part of the sediment gathers these different processes, separated in a vertical structure for the soil loss and lateral structure for the transport in overland flow.",

    "section": "Soil Erosion",
    "text": "Soil Erosion\nThe first process to consider in sediment dynamics is the generation of sediments by land erosion. The main processes behind soil loss are rainfall erosion and overland flow erosion. In order to model such processes at a fine time and space scale, physics-based models such as ANSWERS and EUROSEM were chosen here.\nThe choice of rainfall erosion method is set up in the model section of the TOML:\n[model]\nrainerosmethod = \"answers\" # Rainfall erosion equation: [\"answers\", \"eurosem\"]\n\nRainfall erosion\nIn wflow_sediment, rainfall erosion can both be modelled using EUROSEM or ANSWERS equation. The main difference between the models is that EUROSEM uses a more physics-based approach based on the kinetic energy of the rain drops impacting the soil (Morgan et al, 1998), while ANSWERS is more empirical and uses parameters from the USLE model (Beasley et al, 1991).\nIn EUROSEM, rainfall erosion is modelled according to rainfall intensity and its kinetic energy when it reaches the soil according to equations developed by Brandt (1990). As the intensity of the rain kinetic energy depends on the length of the fall, rainfall intercepted by vegetation will then be reduced compared to direct throughfall. The kinetic energy of direct throughfall is estimated by (Morgan et al, 1998): \\[\n   \\subtext{\\mathrm{KE}}{direct} = 8.95 + 8.44\\,\\log_{10}(R_i)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{KE}}{direct}}{J m^{-2} mm^{-1}}\\) is the kinetic energy of direct throughfall and \\(\\SIb{R_i}{mm h^{-1}}\\) is rainfall intensity. If the rainfall is intercepted by vegetation and falls as leaf drainage, its kinetic energy is then reduced according to (Brandt, 1990): \\[\n   \\subtext{\\mathrm{KE}}{leaf} = 15.8\\,\\sqrt{H_p} - 5.87\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{KE}}{leaf}}{J m^{-2} mm^{-1}}\\) is kinetic energy of leaf drainage and \\(\\SIb{H_p}{m}\\) is the effective canopy height (half of plant height). Canopy height can be derived from the global map from Simard & al. (2011) or by user input depending on the land use.\nKinetic energies from both direct throughfall and leaf drainage are then multiplied by the respective depths of direct throughfall and leaf drainage (mm) and added to get the total rainfall kinetic energy \\(\\mathrm{KE}\\). The soil detached by rainfall \\(\\SIb{D_R}{g m^{-2}}\\) is then: \\[\n   D_R = k\\,\\mathrm{KE}\\,e^{-\\varphi h}\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{k}{g J^{-1}}\\) is an index of the detachability of the soil, \\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{KE}}{J\nm^{-2}}\\) is the total rainfall kinetic energy, \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) is the surface runoff depth on the soil and \\(\\varphi\\) is an exponent varying between \\(0.9\\) and \\(3.1\\) used to reduce rainfall impact if the soil is already covered by water. As a simplification, Torri (1987) has shown that a value of \\(2.0\\) for \\(\\varphi\\) is representative enough for a wide range of soil conditions. The detachability of the soil \\(k\\) depends on the soil texture (proportion of clay, silt and sand content) and corresponding values are defined in EUROSEM user guide (Morgan et al, 1998). As a simplification, in wflow_sediment, the mean value of the detachability shown in the table below are used. Soil texture can for example be derived from the topsoil clay and silt content from SoilGrids (Hengl et al, 2017).\n\nMean detachability of soil depending on its texture (Morgan et al, 1998).\n\n\nTexture (USDA system)\nMean detachability \\(\\SIb{k}{g J^{-1}}\\)\n\n\n\n\nClay\n2.0\n\n\nClay Loam\n1.7\n\n\nSilt\n1.2\n\n\nSilt Loam\n1.5\n\n\nLoam\n2.0\n\n\nSandy Loam\n2.6\n\n\nLoamy Sand\n3.0\n\n\nFine Sand\n3.5\n\n\nSand\n1.9\n\n\n\nRainfall erosion is handled differently in ANSWERS. There, the impacts of vegetation and soil properties are handled through the USLE coefficients in the equation (Beasley et al, 1991): \\[\n   D_R = 0.108 \\, \\subtext{C}{USLE} \\, \\subtext{K}{USLE} \\, A_i \\, R_i^2\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{D_R}{kg min^{-1}}\\) is the soil detachment by rainfall, \\(\\subtext{C}{USLE}\\) is the soil cover-management factor from the USLE equation, \\(\\subtext{K}{USLE}\\) is the soil erodibility factor from the USLE equation, \\(\\SIb{A_i}{m^2}\\) is the area of the cell and \\(\\SIb{R_i}{mm\\;min^{-1}}\\) is the rainfall intensity. There are several methods available to estimate the \\(C\\) and \\(K\\) factors from the USLE. They can come from user input maps, for example maps resulting from Panagos & al.’s recent studies for Europe (Panagos et al, 2015) (Ballabio et al, 2016). To get an estimate of the \\(C\\) factor globally, the other method is to estimate \\(C\\) values for the different land use type in from global land cover maps (e.g. GlobCover). An example is given for the global land cover map GlobCover, summed up in the table below, the values come from a literature study including Panagos et al.’s review (2015), Gericke & al. (2015), Mansoor & al. (2013), Chadli et al. (2016), de Vente et al. (2009), Borrelli et al. (2014), Yang et al. (2003) and Bosco et al. (2015).\nThe other methods to estimate the USLE \\(K\\) factor are to use either topsoil composition or topsoil geometric mean diameter. \\(K\\) estimation from topsoil composition is estimated with the equation developed in the EPIC model (Williams et al, 1983): \\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n   \\subtext{K}{USLE} = \\left[ 0.2 + 0.3\\exp\\left(-0.0256\\;\\mathrm{SAN}\\frac{(1-\\mathrm{SIL})}{100}\\right) \\right]\n   \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{SIL}}{\\mathrm{CLA}+\\mathrm{SIL}}\\right)^{0.3} \\\\\n   \\left(1-\\frac{0.25\\;\\mathrm{OC}}{\\mathrm{OC}+e^{3.72-2.95\\;\\mathrm{OC}}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{0.75\\;\\mathrm{SN}}{\\mathrm{SN}+e^{-5.51+22.9\\;\\mathrm{SN}}}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{CLA}}{\\%}\\), \\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{SIL}}{\\%}\\), \\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{SAN}}{\\%}\\) are respectively the clay, silt and sand fractions of the topsoil, \\(\\SIb{OC}{\\%}\\) is the topsoil organic carbon content and \\(\\mathrm{SN} = 1-\\mathrm{SAN}/100\\). These soil parameters can be derived for example from the SoilGrids dataset. The \\(K\\) factor can also be estimated from the soil mean geometric diameter using the formulation from the RUSLE guide by Renard & al. (1997): \\[\n   \\subtext{K}{USLE} = 0.0034 + 0.0405\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{\\log_{10}(D_g)+1.659}{0.7101}\\right)^2\\right)\n\\] where \\(D_g\\) is the soil geometric mean diameter (mm) estimated from topsoil clay, silt, sand fraction.\n\nEstimation of USLE C factor per Globcover land use type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobCover Value\nGlobcover label\n\\(\\subtext{C}{USLE}\\)\n\n\n\n\n11\nPost-flooding or irrigated croplands (or aquatic)\n0.2\n\n\n14\nRainfed croplands\n0.35\n\n\n20\nMosaic cropland (50-70%) vegetation (grassland/shrubland/forest) (20-50%)\n0.27\n\n\n30\nMosaic vegetation (grassland/shrubland/forest) (50-70%) / cropland (20-50%)\n0.25\n\n\n40\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) broadleaved evergreen or semi-deciduous forest (&gt;5m)\n0.0065\n\n\n50\nClosed (&gt;40%) broadleaved deciduous forest (&gt;5m)\n0.001\n\n\n60\nOpen (15-40%) broadleaved deciduous forest/woodland (&gt;5m)\n0.01\n\n\n70\nClosed (&gt;40%) needleleaved evergreen forest (&gt;5m)\n0.001\n\n\n90\nOpen (15-40%) needleleaved deciduous or evergreen forest (&gt;5m)\n0.01\n\n\n100\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) mixed broadleaved and needleleaved forest (&gt;5m)\n0.02\n\n\n110\nMosaic forest or shrubland (50-70%) / grassland (20-50%)\n0.015\n\n\n120\nMosaic grassland (50-70%) / forest or shrubland (20-50%)\n0.03\n\n\n130\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) (broadleaved or needleleaved, evergreen or deciduous) shrubland (&lt;5m)\n0.035\n\n\n140\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) herbaceous vegetation (grassland, savannas or lichens/mosses)\n0.05\n\n\n150\nSparse (&lt;15%) vegetation\n0.35\n\n\n160\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) broadleaved forest regularly flooded (semi-permanently or temporarily) - Fresh or brackish water\n0.001\n\n\n170\nClosed (&gt;40%) broadleaved forest or shrubland permanently flooded - Saline or brackish water\n0.0005\n\n\n180\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) grassland or woody vegetation on regularly flooded or waterlogged soil - Fresh, brackish or saline water\n0.04\n\n\n190\nArtificial surfaces and associated areas (Urban areas &gt;50%)\n0.0\n\n\n200\nBare areas\n0.0\n\n\n210\nWater bodies\n0.0\n\n\n220\nPermanent snow and ice\n0.0\n\n\n230\nNo data (burnt areas, clouds,…)\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\nOverland flow erosion\nOverland flow (or surface runoff) erosion is induced by the strength of the shear stress of the surface water on the soil. As in rainfall erosion, the effect of the flow shear stress can be reduced by the soil vegetation or by the soil properties. In wflow_sediment, soil detachment by overland flow is modelled as in ANSWERS with (Beasley et al, 1991): \\[\n   D_G = 0.90 \\, \\subtext{C}{USLE} \\, \\subtext{K}{USLE} \\, A_i \\, S \\, q\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{D_F}{kg\\;min^{-1}}\\) is soil detachment by flow, \\(\\subtext{C}{USLE}\\) and \\(\\subtext{K}{USLE}\\) are the USLE cover and soil erodibility factors, \\(\\SIb{A_i}{m^2}\\) is the cell area, \\(S\\) is the slope gradient and \\(\\SIb{q}{m^2 min^{-1}}\\) is the overland flow rate per unit width. The USLE \\(C\\) and \\(K\\) factors can be estimated with the same methods as for rainfall erosion and here the slope gradient is obtained from the sinus rather than the tangent of the slope angle.",

    "text": "wflow_sediment\nThe processes and fate of many particles and pollutants impacting water quality at the catchment level are intricately linked to the processes governing sediment dynamics. Both nutrients such as phosphorus, carbon or other pollutants such as metals are influenced by sediment properties in processes such as mobilization, flocculation or deposition. To better assert and model water quality in inland systems, a better comprehension and modelling of sediment sources and fate in the river is needed at a spatial and time scale relevant to such issues.\nThe wflow_sediment model was developed to answer such issues. It is a distributed physics-based model, based on the distributed hydrologic wflow_sbm model. It is able to simulate both land and in-stream processes, and relies on available global datasets, parameter estimation and small calibration effort.\nIn order to model the exports of terrestrial sediment to the coast through the Land Ocean Aquatic Continuum or LOAC (inland waters network such as streams, lakes…), two different modelling parts were considered. The first part, called the inland sediment model, is the modelling and estimation of soil loss and sediment yield to the river system by land erosion, separated into vertical Soil Erosion processes and lateral Sediment Flux in overland flow. The second part, called the River Sediment Model is the transport and processes of the sediment in the river system. The two parts together constitute the wflow_sediment model.\nOverview of the concepts of the wflow_sediment model: \n\nConfiguration\nAs sediment generation and transport processes are linked to the hydrology and water flows, the inputs to the wflow_sediment model come directly from a hydrological model. The required dynamic inputs to run wflow_sediment are:\n\nPrecipitation (can also come from the hydrological forcing data),\nLand runoff (overland flow) from the kinematic wave,\nRiver runoff from the kinematic wave,\nLand water level in the kinematic wave,\nRiver water level in the kinematic wave,\nRainfall interception by the vegetation.\n\nThese inputs can be obtained from wflow_sbm or from other sources.\nModel outputs can be saved for both the inland and the instream part of the model.

    "text": "Inland Sediment Model\n\nSediment Flux in overland flow\nOnce the amount of soil detached by both rainfall and overland flow has been estimated, it has then to be routed and delivered to the river network. Inland routing in sediment models is usually done by comparing the amount of detached sediment with the transport capacity of the flow, which is the maximum amount of sediment that the flow can carry downslope. There are several existing formulas available in the literature. For a wide range of slopes and for overland flow, the Govers equation (1990) seems the most appropriate choice (Hessel et al, 2007). However, as the wflow_sediment model was developed to be linked to water quality issues, the Yalin transport equation was chosen as it can handle particle differentiation (Govers equation can still be used if wflow_sediment is used to only model inland processes with no particle differentiation). For land cells, wflow_sediment assumes that erosion can mobilize 5 classes of sediment:\n\nClay (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{2}{\\mu m}\\))\nSilt (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{10}{\\mu m}\\))\nSand (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{200}{\\mu m}\\))\nSmall aggregates (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{30}{\\mu m}\\))\nLarge aggregates (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{50}{\\mu m}\\)).\n\n$$\n\\[\\begin{gathered}\n   \\mathrm{PSA} = \\mathrm{SAN} (1-\\mathrm{CLA})^{2.4} \\\\\n   \\mathrm{PSI} = 0.13\\mathrm{SIL}\\\\\n   \\mathrm{PCL} = 0.20\\mathrm{CLA} \\\\\n\n   \\mathrm{SAG} =\n   \\begin{align*}\n      \\begin{cases}\n         2.0\\mathrm{CLA} &\\text{ if }\\quad \\mathrm{CLA} &lt; 0.25 \\\\\n         0.28(\\mathrm{CLA}-0.25)+0.5 &\\text{ if }\\quad 0.25 \\leq \\mathrm{CLA} \\leq 0.5 \\\\\n         0.57 &\\text{ if }\\quad \\mathrm{CLA} &gt; 0.5\n      \\end{cases}\n   \\end{align*} \\\\\n\n   \\mathrm{LAG} = 1 - \\mathrm{PSA} - \\mathrm{PSI} - \\mathrm{PCL} - \\mathrm{SAG}\n\\end{gathered}\\]\n$$\nwhere \\(\\mathrm{CLA}\\), \\(\\mathrm{SIL}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{SAN}\\) are the primary clay, silt, sand fractions of the topsoil and \\(\\mathrm{PCL}\\), \\(\\mathrm{PSI}\\), \\(\\mathrm{PSA}\\), \\(\\mathrm{SAG}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{LAG}\\) are the clay, silt, sand, small and large aggregates fractions of the detached sediment respectively.

    "section": "River Sediment Model",
    "text": "River Sediment Model\nSediment dynamics in rivers can be described by the same three processes on land: erosion, deposition and transport. The difference is that channel ﬂow is much higher, deeper and permanent compared to overland ﬂow. In channels, erosion is the direct removal of sediments from the river bed or bank (lateral erosion). Sediments are transported in the river either by rolling, sliding and silting (bed load transport) or via turbulent flow in the higher water column (suspended load transport). The type of transport is determined by the river bed shear stress. As sediment particles have a higher density than water, they can also be deposited on the river bed according to their settling velocity compared to the ﬂow velocity. In addition to regular deposition in the river, lakes, reservoirs and floodplains represents additional major sediment settling pools.\nComplete models of sediment dynamics based on hydrology and not on hydraulics or hydrodynamics are much rarer than for soil loss and inland dynamics. The simpler models such as the SWAT default sediment river model uses again the transport capacity of the ﬂow to determine if there is erosion or deposition (Neitsch et al., 2011). A more physics-based approach (Partheniades, 1965) to determine river erosion is used by Liu et al. (2018) and in the new SWAT’s approach developed by Narasimhan et al. (2017). For wﬂow_sediment, the new physics-based model of SWAT was chosen for transport and erosion as it enables the use of parameter estimation for erosion of bed and bank of the channel and separates the suspended from the bed loads.\n\n\n\nOverview of the different processes for a river cell in wflow_sediment.\n\n\nRunning the river model is an option of the wflow_sediment model and is enabled using the TOML file. By default it is false:\n[model]\nrunrivermodel = true\n\nSediment inputs in a river cell\nThe first part of the river model assesses how much detached sediment are in the river cell at the beginning of the timestep \\(t\\). Sources of detached sediment are sediments coming from land erosion, estimated with the soil loss part of wflow_sediment model, the sediment coming from upstream river cells and the detached sediment that were left in the cell at the end of the previous timestep (t-1): \\[\n   (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in})_t = (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{land})_t + \\mathrm{upstream}\\left[(\\subtext{\\text{sed}}{out})_{t-1}\\right] + (\\subtext{\\text{sed}}{riv})_{t-1}\n\\]\n\n\nRiver transport and erosion\nOnce the amount of sediment inputs at the beginning of the timestep is known, the model then estimates transport, and river erosion if there is a deficit of sediments. Transport in the river system is estimated via a transport capacity formula. There are several transport capacity formulas available in wflow_sediment, some requiring calibration and some not. Choosing a transport capacity equation depends on the river characteristics (some equation are more suited for narrow or wider rivers), and on the reliability of the required river parameters (such as slope, width or mean particle diameter of the river channel). Several river transport capacity are available and the choice is set up in the model section of the TOML:\n[model]\nrivtransportmethod = \"bagnold\" # River flow transport capacity method: [\"bagnold\", \"engelund\", \"yang\", \"kodatie\", \"molinas\"]\nSimplified Bagnold\nOriginally more valid for intermediate to large rivers, this simplified version of the Bagnold equation relates sediment transport to flow velocity with two simple calibration parameters (Neitsch et al, 2011): \\[\nC_{\\max} = \\subtext{c}{sp}  \\left( \\dfrac{\\mathrm{prf} Q}{h W} \\right)^{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{C_{\\max}}{kg L^{-1}}\\) (or \\(\\SIb{}{ton m^{-1}}\\)) is the sediment concentration, \\(\\SIb{Q}{m^3 s^{-1}}\\) is the surface runoff in the river cell, \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) is the river water level, \\(\\SIb{W}{m}\\) is the river width and \\(\\subtext{c}{sp}\\), \\(\\mathrm{prf}\\) and \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}\\) are calibration parameters. The \\(\\mathrm{prf}\\) coefficient is usually used to deduce the peak velocity of the flow, but for simplification in wflow_sediment, the equation was simplified to only get two parameters to calibrate: \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}\\) and \\(\\subtext{c}{Bagnold} = \\subtext{c}{sp} \\,\n\\mathrm{prf}^{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}}\\). The coefficient \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}\\) usually varies between \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) while \\(\\mathrm{prf}\\) and \\(\\subtext{c}{sp}\\) have a wider range of variation.

The resulting equation, for a rectangular channel, is (Neitsch et al, 2011): \\[\n   C_{\\max} = \\left( \\dfrac{a u^{b} h^{c} S^{d}}{\\subtext{V}{in}} \\right)  W\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{V}{in}}{m^3}\\) in the volume of water entering the river cell during the timestep and \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are coefficients depending on the riverbed sediment size. Values of these coefficients are summarized in the table below.\n\nRange of the simplified Bagnold coefficients (and calibrated value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiver sediment diameter\na\nb\nc\nd\n\n\n\n\n\\(D_{50} \\leq \\SI{0.05}{mm}\\)\n281.4\n2.622\n0.182\n0\n\n\n\\(\\SI{0.05}{mm} &lt; D_{50} \\leq \\SI{0.25}{mm}\\)\n2 829.6\n3.646\n0.406\n0.412\n\n\n\\(\\SI{0.25}{mm} &lt; D_{50} \\leq \\SI{2.0}{mm}\\)\n2 123.4\n3.300\n0.468\n0.613\n\n\n\\(D_{50} &gt; \\SI{2.0}{mm}\\)\n431 884.8\n1.000\n1.000\n2.000\n\n\n\nYang Yang (1996) developed a set of two equations giving transport of sediments for sand-bed or gravel-bed rivers. The sand equation (\\(D_{50} &lt; \\SI{2.0}{mm}\\)) is: \\[\n   \\log\\left(C_{ppm}\\right) = 5.435 - 0.286\\log\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\\nu}\\right)-0.457\\log\\left(\\frac{u_*}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right) \\\\\n   +\\left(1.799-0.409\\log\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\\nu}\\right)-0.314\\log\\left(\\frac{u_*}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right)\\right)\\log\\left(\\frac{uS}{\\omega_{s,50}}-\\frac{u_{cr}S}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right)\n\\] And the gravel equation (\\(\\SI{2.0}{mm} \\leq D_{50} &lt; \\SI{10.0}{mm}\\)) is: \\[\n   \\log\\left(C_{ppm}\\right) = 6.681 - 0.633\\log\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\\nu}\\right)-4.816\\log\\left(\\frac{u_*}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right) \\\\\n   +\\left(2.784-0.305\\log\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\\nu}\\right)-0.282\\log\\left(\\frac{u_*}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right)\\right)\\log\\left(\\frac{uS}{\\omega_{s,50}}-\\frac{u_{cr}S}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right)\n\\] where \\(C_{ppm}\\) is sediment concentration in parts per million by weight, \\(\\SIb{\\omega_{s,50}}{m s^{-1}}\\) is the settling velocity of a particle with the median riverbed diameter estimated with Stokes, \\(\\SIb{\\nu}{m^2 s^{-1}}\\) is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, \\(\\SIb{u_*}{m s^{-1}}\\) is the shear velocity where \\(u_* = \\sqrt{gR_{H}S}\\) with \\(R_{H}\\) the hydraulic radius of the river and \\(\\SIb{u_{cr}}{m s^{-1}}\\) is the critical velocity (equation can be found in Hessel, 2007).\nMolinas and Wu The Molinas and Wu (2001) transport equation was developed for large sand-bed rivers based on the universal stream power \\(\\psi\\). The corresponding equation is (Neitsch et al, 2011): \\[\n   C_{w} = \\dfrac{1430 (0.86+\\sqrt{\\psi}) \\psi^{1.5}}{0.016+\\psi} 10^{-6}\n\\] where \\(\\psi\\) is the universal stream power given by: \\[\n   \\psi = \\dfrac{\\psi^{3}}{\\left(\\dfrac{\\rho_{s}}{\\rho}-1\\right) g h \\omega_{s,50}  \\left[ \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{h}{D_{50}}\\right)\\right]^{2}}\n\\]\nOnce the maximum concentration \\(C_{\\max}\\) is established with one of the above transport formula, the model then determines if there is erosion of the river bed and bank. In order to do that, the difference \\(sed_{ex}\\) between the maximum amount of sediment estimated with transport (\\(\\mathrm{sed}_{\\max} = C_{\\max} \\subtext{V}{in}\\)) and the sediment inputs to the river cell (\\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in}\\) calculated above) is calculated. If too much sediment is coming in and \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{ex}\\) is negative, then there is no river bed and bank erosion. And if the river has not reach its maximum transport capacity, then erosion of the river happens.\nFirst, the sediments stored in the cell from deposition in previous timesteps \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{stor}\\) are eroded from clay to gravel. If this amount is not enough to cover \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{ex}\\), then erosion of the local river bed and bank material starts.\nInstead of just setting river erosion amount to just cover the remaining difference \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{exeff}\\) between \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{ex}\\) and \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{stor}\\), actual erosion potential is adjusted using river characteristics and is separated between the bed and bank of the river using the physics-based approach of Knight (1984).\nThe bed and bank of the river are supposed to only be able to erode a maximum amount of their material E_{R,\\mathrm{bed}} for the bed and E_{R,\\mathrm{bank}} for the river bank. For a rectangular channel, assuming it is meandering and thus only one bank is prone to erosion, they are calculated from the equations (Neitsch et al, 2011): \\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n   E_{R,\\mathrm{bed}} = k_{d,\\mathrm{bed}} \\left( \\tau_{e,\\mathrm{bed}} - \\tau_{cr,\\mathrm{bed}} \\right) 10^{-6}  L  W  \\rho_{b, \\mathrm{bed}}  \\Delta t \\\\\n   E_{R,\\mathrm{bank}} = k_{d,\\mathrm{bank}} \\left( \\tau_{e,\\mathrm{bank}} - \\tau_{cr,\\mathrm{bank}} \\right) 10^{-6} L h \\rho_{b, \\mathrm{bank}}  \\Delta t\n\\end{gathered}\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{E_R}{ton}\\) is the potential bed/bank erosion rates, \\(\\SIb{k_d}{cm^3 N^{-1},\ns^{-1}}\\) is the erodibility of the bed/bank material, \\(\\SIb{\\tau_e}{N m^{-2}}\\) is the effective shear stress from the flow on the bed/bank, \\(\\SIb{\\tau_{cr}}{N m^{-2}}\\) is the critical shear stress for erosion to happen, \\(\\SIb{L}{m}\\), \\(\\SIb{W}{m}\\) and \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) are the channel length, width and water height, \\(\\SIb{\\rho_{b}}{g cm^{-3}}\\) is the bulk density of the bed/bank of the river and \\(\\SIb{\\Delta t}{s}\\) is the model timestep.\nIn wflow_sediment, the erodibility of the bed/bank are approximated using the formula from Hanson and Simon (2001): \\[\n   k_d=0.2 \\tau_{cr}^{-0.5}\n\\] Normally erodibilities are evaluated using jet test in the field and there are several reviews and some adjustments possible to this equation (Simon et al, 2011). However, to avoid too heavy calibration and for the scale considered, this equation is supposed to be efficient enough. The critical shear stress \\(\\tau_{cr}\\) is evaluated differently for the bed and bank. For the bed, the most common formula from Shields initiation of movement is used. For the bank, a more recent approach from Julian and Torres (2006) is used : \\[\n   \\tau_{cr,\\mathrm{bank}} = (0.1+0.1779 SC+0.0028 SC^{2}-2.34 10^{-5}  SC^{3}) C_{ch}\n\\] where \\(SC\\) is the percent clay and silt content of the river bank and \\(C_{ch}\\) is a coefficient taking into account the positive impact of vegetation on erosion reduction. This coefficient is then dependent on the land use and classical values are shown in the table below. These values where then adapted for use with the GlobCover land use map. Percent of clay and silt (along with sand and gravel) for the channel is estimated from the river median particle diameter assuming the same values as SWAT shown in the table below. Median particle diameter is here estimated depending on the Strahler river order. The higher the order, the smaller the diameter is. As the median diameter is only used in wflow_sediment for the estimation of the river bed/bank sediment composition, this supposition should be enough. Actual refined data or calibration may however be needed if the median diameter is also required for the transport formula. In a similar way, the bulk densities of river bed and bank are also just assumed to be of respectively \\(\\SI{1.5}{g cm^{-3}}\\) and \\(\\SI{1.4}{g cm^{-3}}\\).\n\nClassical values of the channel cover vegetation coefficient (Julian and Torres, 2006)\n\n\nBank vegetation\n\\(C_{ch}\\)\n\n\n\n\nNone\n1.00\n\n\nGrassy\n1.97\n\n\nSparse trees\n5.40\n\n\nDense trees\n19.20\n\n\n\n\nComposition of the river bed/bank depending on the median diameter \\(\\SIb{d_{50}}{\\mu m}\\) (Neitsch et al, 2011)\n\n\nSediment Fraction\n\\(\\leq\\) 5\n5 to 50\n50 to 2000\n\\(&gt;\\) 2000\n\n\n\n\nSand\n0.15\n0.15\n0.65\n0.15\n\n\nSilt\n0.15\n0.65\n0.15\n0.15\n\n\nClay\n0.65\n0.15\n0.15\n0.05\n\n\nGravel\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n0.65\n\n\n\nThen, the repartition of the flow shear stress is refined into the effective shear stress and the bed and bank of the river using the equations developed by Knight (1984) for a rectangular channel: \\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n   \\tau_{e,\\mathrm{bed}} = \\rho g R_{H} S  \\left(1 - \\dfrac{SF_{\\mathrm{bank}}}{100}\\right) \\left(1+\\dfrac{2h}{W}\\right) \\\\\n   \\tau_{e,\\mathrm{bank}} = \\rho g R_{H} S  \\left( SF_{\\mathrm{bank}}\\right)  \\left(1+\\dfrac{W}{2h}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n\\] where \\(\\rho g\\) is the fluid specific weight (\\(\\SI{9800}{N m^{-3}}\\) for water), \\(\\SIb{R_H}{m}\\) is the hydraulic radius of the channel, \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) and \\(\\SIb{W}{m}\\) are the water level and river width. \\(SF_{\\mathrm{bank}}\\) is the proportion of shear stress acting on the bank (%) and is estimated from (Knight, 1984): \\[\n   \\mathrm{SF}_{\\mathrm{bank}} = \\exp \\left( -3.230 \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{W}{h}+3\\right)+6.146 \\right)\n\\] Finally the relative erosion potential of the bank and bed of the river is calculated by: \\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n   \\mathrm{RTE}_{\\mathrm{bed}} = \\dfrac{E_{R,\\mathrm{bed}}}{E_{R,\\mathrm{bed}}+E_{R,\\mathrm{bank}}} \\\\\n   \\mathrm{RTE}_{\\mathrm{bank}} = 1 - RTE_{\\mathrm{bed}}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\] And the final actual eroded amount for the bed and bank is the maximum between \\(\\mathrm{RTE}\n\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{exeff}\\) and the erosion potential \\(E_R\\). Total eroded amount of sediment \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod}\\) is then the sum of the eroded sediment coming from the storage of previously deposited sediment and the river bed/bank erosion.\n\n\nRiver deposition\nAs sediments have a higher density than water, moving sediments in water can be deposited in the river bed. The deposition process depends on the mass of the sediment, but also on flow characteristics such as velocity. In wflow_sediment, as in SWAT, deposition is modelled with Einstein’s equation (Neitsch et al, 2011): \\[\n   \\subtext{P}{dep}=\\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{e^{x}}\\right)100\n\\] where \\(\\subtext{P}{dep}\\) is the percentage of sediments that is deposited on the river bed and x is a parameter calculated with: \\[\n   x = \\dfrac{1.055 L  \\omega_{s}}{u h}\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{L}{m}\\) and \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) are channel length and water height, \\(\\SIb{\\omega_s}{m\ns^{-1}}\\) is the particle settling velocity calculated with Stokes’ formula and \\(\\SIb{u}{m\ns^{-1}}\\) is the mean flow velocity. The calculated percentage is then subtracted from the amount of sediment input and eroded river sediment for each particle size class (\\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{dep} = \\subtext{P}{dep}/100 (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in} +\n\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod})\\)). Resulting deposited sediment are then stored in the river bed and can be re-mobilized in future time steps by erosion.\n\n\nMass balance and sediment concentration\nFinally after estimating inputs, deposition and erosion with the transport capacity of the flow, the amount of sediment actually leaving the river cell to go downstream is estimated using: \\[\n   \\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{out} = (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in} + \\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod} - \\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{dep}) \\dfrac{\\subtext{V}{out}}{V}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{out}}{ton}\\) is the amount of sediment leaving the river cell (tons), \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in}}{ton}\\) is the amount of sediment coming into the river cell (storage from previous timestep, land erosion and sediment flux from upstream river cells), \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod}}{ton}\\) is the amount of sediment coming from river erosion, \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{dep}}{ton}\\) is the amount of deposited sediments, \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{V}{out}}{m^3}\\) is the volume of water leaving the river cell (surface runoff \\(Q\\) times timestep \\(\\Delta t\\)) and \\(\\SIb{V}{m^3}\\) is the total volume of water in the river cell (\\(\\subtext{V}{out}\\) plus storage \\(h W L\\)).\nA mass balance is then used to calculate the amount of sediment remaining in the cell at the end of the timestep \\((\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{riv})_t\\): \\[\n   (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{riv})_t = (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{riv})_{t-1} + (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{land})_t + \\mathrm{upstream}\\left[(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{out})_{t-1}\\right] + (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod})_t - (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{dep})_t - (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{out})_t\n\\]\n\n\nLake and reservoir modelling\nApart from land and river, the hydrologic wflow_sbm model also handles lakes and reservoirs modelling. In wflow_sbm, lakes and large reservoirs are modelled using a 1D bucket model at the cell corresponding to the outlet. For the other cells belonging to the lake/reservoir which are not the outlet, processes such as precipitation and evaporation are filtered out and shifted to the outlet cell. wflow_sediment handles the lakes and reservoirs in the same way. If a cell belongs to a lake/reservoir and is not the outlet then the model assumes that no erosion/deposition of sediments is happening and the sediments are only all transported to the lake/reservoir outlet. Once the sediments reach the outlet, then sediments are deposited in the lake/reservoir according to Camp’s model (1945) (Verstraeten et al, 2000): \\[\n   \\mathrm{TE} = \\dfrac{\\omega_s}{u_{cr,\\mathrm{res}}} = \\dfrac{\\subtext{A}{res}}{\\subtext{Q}{out,res}} \\omega_s\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathrm{TE}\\) is the trapping efficiency of the lake/reservoir (or the fraction of particles trapped), \\(\\SIb{\\omega_{s}}{m s^{-1}}\\) is the particle velocity from Stokes, \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{u}{cr,res}}{m s^{-1}}\\) is the reservoir’s critical settling velocity which is equal to the reservoir’s outflow \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{Q}{out,res}}{m^3 s^{-1}}\\) divided by the reservoir’s surface area \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{A}{res}}{m^2}\\).\nFor reservoirs, coarse sediment particles from the bed load are also assumed to be trapped by the dam structure. This adding trapping is taken into account with a reservoir trapping efficiency coefficient for large particles (between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\)). Depending on the type of the dam, all bed load particles are trapped (restrapefficiency = 1.0, for example for a gravity dam) or only partly (for example for run-of-the-river dams).\nLake and reservoir modelling is enabled in the model section of the TOML and require the extra following input arguments:\n[model]\ndoreservoir = true\ndolake = false\n\n[input.vertical]\n# Reservoir\nresareas = \"wflow_reservoirareas\"\n# Lake\nlakeareas = \"wflow_lakeareas\"\n\n[input.lateral.river]\n# Reservoir\nresarea = \"ResSimpleArea\"\nrestrapefficiency = \"ResTrapEff\"\nresareas = \"wflow_reservoirareas\"\nreslocs = \"wflow_reservoirlocs\"\n# Lake\nlakearea = \"LakeArea\"\nlakeareas = \"wflow_lakeareas\"\nlakelocs = \"wflow_lakelocs\"\nNote that in the inland part, lake and reservoir coverage are used to filter erosion and transport in overland flow.",

    "text": "The main flow routing scheme available in Wflow.jl is the kinematic wave approach for channel and overland flow, assuming that water flow is mostly controlled by topography. The kinematic wave equations are (Chow, 1988):\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n  \\dfrac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} + \\dfrac{\\partial A}{\\partial t} = q,\\\\\n   A = \\alpha Q^{\\beta}.\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nThese equations can then be combined as a function of streamflow only:\n\\[\n    \\dfrac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} + \\alpha \\beta Q^{\\beta - 1} \\dfrac{\\partial Q}{\\partial t} = q.\n\\]\nHere \\(\\SIb{Q}{m^3 s^{-1}}\\) is the surface runoff in the kinematic wave, \\(\\SIb{x}{m}\\) is the length of the runoff pathway, \\(\\SIb{A}{m}\\) is the cross-section area of the runoff pathway, \\(\\SIb{t}{s}\\) is the integration timestep and \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are unitless coefficients.\nThese equations are solved with a nonlinear scheme using Newton’s method and can also be iterated depending on the model space and time resolution.

This assumption holds for steep terrain, but in less steep terrain the hydraulic gradient is likely not equal to the surface slope (subsurface flow), or pressure differences and inertial momentum cannot be neglected (channel and overland flow). In addition, while the kinematic wave equations are solved with a nonlinear scheme using Newton’s method (Chow, 1988), other model equations are solved through a simple explicit scheme. In summary the following limitations apply:\n\nChannel flow, and to a lesser degree overland flow, may be unrealistic in terrain that is not steep, and where pressure forces and inertial momentum are important.\nThe lateral movement of subsurface flow may be very wrong in terrain that is not steep.",

It consists of a single executable, wflow_cli that accepts a single argument, the path to a TOML configuration file.\nBinaries of wflow_cli can be downloaded from our website download.deltares.nl, and are currently available for Windows.\nAfter installing you can see three folders in the installation directory. It is only the bin/wflow_cli that is directly used. All three folders need to stay together however. The share folder contains TOML files with more information about the build.\nbin\\wflow_cli\nlib\nshare\nSimply running wflow_cli with no arguments will give the following message:\nUsage: wflow_cli 'path/to/config.toml'\nWhen starting a run, you will see basic run information on the screen, as well as a progress bar, that gives an estimate of how much time is needed to finish the simulation:\n┌ Info: Run information\n│   model_type = \"sbm\"\n│   starttime = CFTime.DateTimeStandard(2000-01-01T00:00:00)\n│   dt = 86400 seconds\n│   endtime = CFTime.DateTimeStandard(2000-12-31T00:00:00)\n└   nthreads() = 4\n\nProgress: 100%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████| Time: 0:00:27",

    "section": "Data requirements",
    "text": "Data requirements\nThe actual data requirements depend on the application of the Model and the Model type. Both forcing and static data should be provided in netCDF format, with the same grid definition for forcing and static data. The only exception is storage and rating curves for lakes, that should be provided in CSV format, see also Additional settings for waterbodies.\n\nForcing data:\n\nPrecipitation\nPotential evapotranspiration\nTemperature (optional, only needed for snow and glacier modelling)\n\n\nThe requirements for static data (including model parameters) depend on the Model type. The following data is required for all Model types, but not directly part of a Model component:\n\nflow direction data (D8)\nriver map (location of the river)\nsub-catchment map (model domain)\n\nFor the flow direction (D8) data, the PCRaster ldd convention is used, see also PCRaster ldd. An approach to generate ldd data is to make use of the Python package pyflwdir:\n\nto upscale existing flow direction data as the 3 arcsec MERIT Hydro data (Yamazaki et al., 2019)\nor to derive flow directions from elevation data,\n\nsee also Eilander et al. (2021) for more information. Pyflwdir is also used by the hydroMT Python package described in the next paragraph. Another approach to generate ldd data is to make use of PCRaster functionality, see for example lddcreate.\nOptionally, but also not directly part of a model component are gauge locations, that are used to extract gridded data from certain locations.\nThe different supported model configurations are described in the section Model configurations. Wflow_sbm models have the vertical concept SBM in common and input parameters for this component are described in the SBM model parameters table. For wflow_sbm models there are two ways to include subsurface flow:\n\nThe kinematic wave approach (see section Subsurface flow routing) as part of the sbm model type. Parameters that are part of this component are described in the Lateral subsurface flow section of Model parameters. Input parameters for this component are derived from the SBM vertical concept and the land slope. One external parameter (ksathorfrac) is used to calculate the horizontal hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface kh_0.\nGroundwater flow (see section Groundwater flow component) as part of the sbm_gwf model type. For the unconfined aquifer the input parameters are described in the section Unconfined aquifer of Model parameters. The bottom (bottom) of the groundwater layer is derived from from the soilthickness [mm] parameter of SBM and the provided surface elevation altitude [m] as part of the static input. The area parameter is derived from the model grid. Parameters that are part of the boundary conditions of the unconfined aquifer are listed under Constant Head and Boundary conditions of the Model parameters section.\n\nMost hydrological model configurations make use of the kinematic wave surface routing (river flow, overland flow or both) and input data required for the river and overland flow components is described in Surface flow. There is also the option to use the local inertial model as part of the wflow_sbm models (model types sbm and sbm_gwf):\n\nfor river flow, see also the Local inertial river and floodplain model.\nfor 1D river flow and 2D overland flow combined, see also the Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D) model.\n\nInput parameters for this approach are described in River flow (local inertial), including the optional 1D floodplain schematization, and Overland flow (local inertial) of the Model parameters section.\nReservoirs or lakes can be part of the kinematic wave or local inertial model for river flow and input parameters are described in Reservoirs and Lakes.\nThe wflow_sediment model configuration consists of the vertical Soil Erosion concept and the input parameters for this concept are described in the Sediment section of the Model parameters. The parameters of the lateral Sediment Flux in overland flow concept are described in the Overland flow section of the Model parameters. Parameters of this component are not directly set by data from static input. The input parameters of the lateral concept River Sediment Model are listed in River flow of the Model parameters section.\nThe Model parameters section lists all the parameters per Model component and these Tables can also be used to check which parameters can be part of the output, see also Output netCDF section and Output CSV section.\nExample models can be found in the Example models section.",

    "text": "Vertical and lateral models\nThe different model concepts used in wflow are defined as parametric composite types. For example the vertical SBM concept is defined as follows: struct SBM{T,N,M}. T, N and M between curly braces after the struct name refer to type parameters, for more information about type parameters you can check out Type parameters. Since these parameters can be of any type, it is possible to declare an unlimited number of composite types. The type parameters are used to set the type of struct fields, below an example with a part of the SBM struct:\n@get_units @with_kw struct SBM{T,N,M}\n    # Model time step [s]\n    dt::T | \"s\"\n    # Maximum number of soil layers\n    maxlayers::Int | \"-\"\n    # number of cells\n    n::Int | \"-\"\n    # Number of soil layers\n    nlayers::Vector{Int} | \"-\"\n    # Number of unsaturated soil layers\n    n_unsatlayers::Vector{Int} | \"-\"\n    # Fraction of river [-]\n    riverfrac::Vector{T} | \"-\"\n    # Saturated water content (porosity) [mm mm⁻¹]\n    theta_s::Vector{T} | \"mm mm-1\"\n    # Residual water content [mm mm⁻¹]\n    theta_r::Vector{T} | \"mm mm-1\"\n    # Vertical hydraulic conductivity [mm Δt⁻¹] at soil surface\n    kv_0::Vector{T} | \"mm dt-1\"\n    # Muliplication factor [-] applied to kv_z (vertical flow)\n    kvfrac::Vector{SVector{N,T}} | \"-\"\nThe type parameter T is used in wflow as a subtype of AbstractFloat, allowing to store fields with a certain floating point precision (e.g. Float64 or Float32) in a flexible way. N refers to the maximum number of soil layers of the SBM soil column, and M refers to the maximum number of soil layers + 1. See also part of the following instance of SBM:\nsbm = SBM{Float,maxlayers,maxlayers + 1}(\n    dt = tosecond(dt),\n    maxlayers = maxlayers,\n    n = n,\nFor the other model concepts, we refer to the code to check these type parameters.",

    "text": "Unreleased\n\nFixed\n\nInitialization of LateralSSF variables ssf and ssfmax with vertical hydraulic conductivity profile exponential_constant. Removed parameter khfrac from the computation, as it is already part of parameter kh_0.\nMutating BMI model control functions (update, update_until and finalize) and extended mutating BMI functions (load_state and save_state) should return nothing.\nAdded downloading of testdata to Dockerfile, to ensure an image was able to build.\nThe reservoir (reservoir_index_f) and lake (lake_index_f) indices as part of network.river were not correct. These were mapped to their own index in the SimpleReservoir and Lake struct, and not to the corresponding river index. This resulted in incorrect surface water abstractions from reservoir and lake volumes, and surface water abstractions were set at zero at the wrong river locations.\nWflow ZMQ server: allow JSON reading and writing of NaN and Inf values to avoid a JSON spec error. For example, during initialization of a wflow model, some (diagnostic) model variables are initialized with NaN values.\nLimit flux from River boundary of GroundwaterFlow to unconfined aquifer based on available river storage (from river flow routing).\nFixed computation of flow width in diagonal flow direction for model type sediment and fixed the computation of the remaining surface flow width (kinematic wave overland flow) for river cells in the diagonal flow direction. For both cases the width should be based on land area and flow length (area conservative).\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nRemoved vertical concepts HBV and FLEXTopo.\nRemoved metadata macros (used by BMI). The variable unit is moved to the standard name mapping dictionaries, and the grid element type information is moved to a BMI helper function.\nRefactor the vertical SBM concept: divide the long struct SBM into different model components for interception, snow, glacier, (open water) runoff, soil, water demand and allocation stored in the struct LandHydrologySBM. Additionally, the atmospheric forcing and a shared vegetation parameterset are stored as separate fields in struct LandHydrologySBM (with soil model SbmSoilModel). The model component structs have model variables, parameters and boundary_conditions (if applicable), including associated functions for initializing and updating these model components. The original long update function of the SBM soil part has been split into separate functions.\nRefactor the lateral (routing) components: as for the vertical SBM concept split the structs into variables, parameters and boundary_conditions (if applicable).\nRefactor the sediment concept: similar to the refactor of SBM concept, the sediment model has been split into three main structures. SoilLoss was split into rainfall_erosion, overland_flow_erosion and (total) soil_erosion concepts. OverlandFlowSediment has been split into transport_capacity, sediment_flux and to_river concepts. RiverSediment has been split into transport_capacity, potential_erosion, sediment_flux and concentrations concepts.\nTimestepping method parameters for solving the kinematic wave and local inertial approaches for river and overland flow are moved to a TimeStepping struct. The timestepping implementation for the kinematic wave is now similar to the local inertial method: a stable timestep is computed for each sub timestep (or a fixed sub timestep is used) as part of a while loop (for each model timestep).\nMap internal model variable and parameter names to CSDMS Standard Names. The previous one to one mapping can be used to output model variables and parameters (TOML config file), but is not considered as part of the public API.\nRefactor TOML configuration file, also as a result of using internal (CSDMS) standard names. Most important changes include: there is now a distinction between static, cyclic and forcing input ([input.static], [input.cyclic] and [input.forcing]) without the need to specify the internal cyclic and forcing variables in a list (only an external name mapping is required), state variables are listed below the [state.variables] TOML section and use of more clearly defined TOML output sections.\nReplaced the variables that can exchange through BMI (list of model components) by a list of standard names below the [API] TOML section.\nUse the instantaneous routing water depth h at the previous model time step to limit open water evaporation and to set the river stage of the GroundwaterFlow model for the current model time step, as it is more accurate then using the average water depth h_av at the previous model time step.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nSupport direct output of snow and glacier melt, and add computation of snow water equivalent (SWE).",

    "text": "v0.x releases\n\nv0.8.1 - 2024-08-27\n\nFixed\n\nReduce allocations in update of vertical SBM concept.\n\n\n\n\nv0.8.0 - 2024-08-19\n\nFixed\n\nAdded missing BMI function get_grid_size, it is used for unstructured grids, for example to get the length of arrays returned by BMI functions get_grid_x and get_grid_y.\nAdded a check for the solution of the quadratic equation as part of the Modified Puls approach for lake outflow. Lower limit should be zero (very small negative values can occur).\nLimit lake evaporation (added variable actevap) and lake outflow to prevent negative lake storage. The variable actevap has also been added to the reservoir module.\nThe set_states function for model type sbm with local inertial routing for river and land component.\nInflow to reservoir and lake locations for local inertial routing: 1) with floodplain routing, the floodplain discharge was not added to the inflow of these locations, 2) the to_river variable from overland flow and lateral subsurface flow was not added to the inflow of these locations.\nClose netCDF NCDataset with state variables in extended BMI function save_state.\nFor the computation of Gash interception model parameter e_r multiply the precipitation input with the canopy fraction (this was only done for the potential evapotranspiration input).\nFunction BMI.update_until could throw an InexactError: Int64 caused by a not whole number, representing how many times (steps) an update of a wflow model is required. This is fixed by using divrem for the computation of the number of steps in this function. An error is thrown when the absolute remainder of divrem is larger than eps(), or when the number of steps is negative.\nFixed internal and external broken links in docs.\nThe internal time step of the local inertial model (stable_timestep function) can get zero when LoopVectorization is applied (@tturbo) to the for loop of these functions. This issue occured on a virtual machine, Windows 10 Enterprise, with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6144 CPU (2 processors). This has been fixed by replacing @tturbo with reduction of Polyester.jl.\nFixed required states of the model type sbm_gwf: added h_av for the river and land domain.\nFor the constanthead boundary of GroundwaterFlow the head should not be changed (was set to top elevation of the aquifer if head &gt; top), and exfiltwater should be 0 for these boundary cells.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nStop exposing scalar variables through BMI. The BMI.get_value_ptr function was not working correctly for scalar model variables (a view was applied). Only a few scalar model parameters are defined, and it is not expected that exposing these variables is required (e.g. for model coupling) while code changes for these variables (including struct fields) are required.\nThe local inertial routing (constant) river boundary condition depth at a ghost node (downstream river outlet) was set at 0.0 in the code and can now be provided through the model parameter netCDF file (riverdepth_bc). In addition, the boundary condition river length dl at a ghost node should be set through the model parameter netCDF file (riverlength_bc), providing this boundary condition through the [model] settings in the TOML file (model.riverlength_bc) has been deprecated.\nAs part of the vertical SBM concept: 1) add variable net_runoff (land runoff minus actual open water evaporation ae_openw_l) and 2) change the definition of variable runoff by removing the subtraction of ae_openw_l (total land runoff). The variable net_runoff is now input to the kinematic wave for overland flow (replaces the original runoff variable as input). The lower limit of the original runoff variable was set at zero, which may result in water balance errors. This lower limit was implemented in the Python version of wflow_sbm, to avoid a very slow kinematic wave solution for surface flow computation (no distinction between a kinematic wave for overland and river flow). When in the Python version of wflow_sbm the kinematic wave for surface flow was split into a river and land component, the lower limit was removed for river runoff (net_runoff_river), but not for land runoff.\nAlways use fractions for the computation of potential evapotranspiration (interception and transpiration) and potential evaporation (open water and soil). Replaced variable et_reftopot by crop coefficient kc (use of et_reftopot has been deprecated).\nFor improved code readability it is now discouraged to use non-ASCII characters for the names of variables, structs, functions and macros. Using the non-ASCII character for built-in operators is still allowed. This change in naming convention is now in effect and all invalid uses of non-ASCII characters have been replaced by ASCII equivalents. This change also impacts the TOML keys kv₀, θᵣ and θₛ. These keys have been replaced with the ASCII versions kv_0, theta_r and theta_s in v0.4.0 and the old keys are not supported anymore.\nDocs: 1) improved description of different model configurations in model-setup.md, also in relation to hydromt_wflow in docs, 2) citing info related to wflow_sbm publication in Geosci. Model Dev. (from in review to published).\nRoot water uptake reduction (Feddes): 1) extend critical pressure head parameters with h3_low and h3_high, 2) all critical pressure head parameters can be set (values for h1, h2 and h3 were fixed) and 3) the root water uptake reduction coefficient \\alpha can be set at 0 (default is 1) at critical pressure head h1 (through the model parameter alpha_h1).\nFor the actual transpiration computation in SBM, the potential transpiration is partitioned over the soil layers with roots according to the model parameter rootfraction (fraction of the total root length in a soil layer). Previously, for each soil layer (from top to bottom) the actual transpiration was computed, and the remaining potential transpiration was used in the next soil layer.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nTotal water storage as an export variable for SBM concept. This is the total water stored per grid cell in millimeters. Excluded from this variable are the floodplain, lakes and reservoirs.\nChecks to see if all states are covered in the .toml file. If not all states are covered, an error is thrown. If there are more states specified than required, these states are ignored (with a warning in the logging), and the simulation will continue.\nSupport different vertical hydraulic conductivity profiles for the SBM concept. See also the following sections: The SBM soil water accounting scheme and Subsurface flow routing for a short description.\nLocal inertial routing to sbm_gwf model type.\nWater demand and allocation computations for model types sbm and sbm_gwf.\n\n\n\n\nv0.7.3 - 2024-01-12\n\nFixed\n\nDocumentation: add leakage term to the wflow_sbm figure, document external input parameter ksathorfrac and fix description of adding external inflow to the kinematic wave.\nFixed BMI functions (e.g. BMI.get_value) that deviated from BMI specifications (BasicModelInterface.jl), including function arguments, return types and the BMI specification that arrays are always flattened (this was not the case for variables stored as 2-dimensional arrays or as vector of SVectors).\nBump compat for NCDatasets to 0.13, 0.14.\nThe solution for lake outflow as part of the Modified Puls Approach. The inflow and outflow variables are defined for period Δt, and not at t1 and t2 (instantaneous) as in the original mass balance equation of the Modified Puls Approach. Because of this, the terms of the quadratic equation (and solution) were fixed.\nUse kvfrac for the computation of vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the soil layer, since kvfrac is also used for the computation of vertical unsaturated flow.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nFor cyclic parameters different cyclic time inputs are supported (only one common cyclic time (for example daily or monthly) was allowed).\nBMI: 1) added grid information (type and location) and whether a variable can be exchanged to metadata Structs, 2) extend model grid functions for wflow components that store variables on edges (local inertial model) with get_grid_edge_count and get_grid_edge_nodes.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nFunctions for loading and saving states and getting the starttime in Unix time format. This is convenient for coupling with OpenDA (and other external) software. The set states functionality from the initialization function has been moved to a separate set_states function for each Model type, to support loading states independent of initialization.\n\n\n\n\nv0.7.2 - 2023-09-27\n\nFixed\n\nWater balance of modified Rutter interception model. The sum of the stemflow partitioning coefficient pt and free throughfall coefficient p could get larger than 1, resulting in an overestimation of stemflow and throughfall amounts and negative net interception amounts. And the first drainage amount dd, controlled by a change over time in canopy storage capacity cmax, should not be subtracted from precipitation to compute net interception.\nThe netinterception (net interception) computed by the modified Rutter interception model was stored as interception in SBM, while this should be the interception (interception loss by evaporation) output of the modified Rutter interception model. The interception of SBM is used to compute the total actual evapotranspiration actevap.\n\n\n\n\nv0.7.1 - 2023-06-30\n\nFixed\n\nState initialization of 1D floodplain volume. In the initialization function the wrong field name of type FloodPlainProfile was used (area instead of a).\n\n\n\n\nv0.7.0 - 2023-06-12\n\nFixed\n\nBMI.get_time_units now gets called on the model rather than the type, like all other BMI functions, except BMI.initialize. Also it returns “s” instead of “seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00”, in line with the BMI specification.\nAdded the interception component to total actual evapotranspiration actevap of SBM (was defined as the sum of soil evaporation, transpiration and open water evaporation).\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nThe time values returned in the BMI interface are no longer in seconds since 1970, but in seconds since the model start time. This is more in line with standard BMI practices.\nThe starttime was defined one model timestep Δt ahead of the actual model time (the initial conditions timestamp (state time)). As a consequence this was also the case for the current model time. To allow for an easier interpretation of wflow time handling, either through BMI or directly, the starttime is now equal to the state time, resulting in current model times without an offset.\nUsing more than 8 threads can result in too much overhead with Threads.@threads. After performance testing, this has been changed for kinematic wave routing and the vertical SBM concept to spawning tasks with Threads@spawn for number of threads &lt;= 8, where each task iterates over a chunk of size basesize. For more than 8 threads the low overhead threading Polyester.@batch (including the minbatch argument) is used. For local inertial routing the use of Threads.@threads has been changed to threaded loop vectorization (river and 1D floodplain local inertial momentum equation) and Polyester.@batch.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nFor (regulated) lakes with rating curve of type 1 (H-Q table), lake storage above the maximumstorage (based on maximum water level from the H-Q table) is spilled instantaneously (overflow) from the lake.\nAdded support to use sum as a reducer function for csv and scalar output options.\n\n\n\n\nv0.6.3 - 2023-03-01\n\nFixed\n\nRemoved error when _FillValue is present in the time dimension of the forcing netCDF file. The simulation is allowed to continue with the attribute present, given that there are no missing values in the time dimension. This is checked by the code, and an error is thrown if this is the case.\nColumn index of daily lake rating curves. This was incorrectly based on dayofyear with a maximum of 365. The column index should be based on julian day (leap days are not counted).\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nNCDatasets version. Reading the time dimension of multifile netCDF file became very slow since NCDatasets v0.12.4, this issue has been solved in v0.12.11.\nStore the time dimension of the forcing netCDF file as part of the struct NCreader instead of calling dataset[\"time\"][:] each time step when loading forcing data.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nShow total duration of simulation in the log file (info), and show the current time at execution of each timestep (debug).\nSupport for exponential decline in horizontal conductivity in the sbm_gwf concept. This can be enabled using the conductivity_profile setting (either “uniform” or “exponential”). If set to “exponential”, it exponentially reduces the kh0 (or conductivity) based on the value of gwf_f to the actual horizontal conductivity (k).\nAn optional 1D floodplain schematization for the river flow inertial model, based on provided flood volumes as a function of flood depth per river cell. See also the following sections: SBM + Local inertial river and River and floodplain routing for a short description, and the following section for associated model parameters.\n\n\n\n\nv0.6.2 - 2022-09-01\n\nFixed\n\nTwo issues related to reservoir and lake locations as part of local inertial model: 1) added as boundary points to the update of overland flow, 2) fixed check reservoir and lake location in update river flow.\nLimit flow (qx, qy and q) in local inertial model when water is not available (set to zero).\nIn the grid output netCDFs, don’t set the _FillValue attribute, since the CF conventions don’t allow it.\nGlacier parameter g_sifrac needs to be converted during initialization (time dependent).\nThe check that the sum of adaptive timesteps (Δt) of the local inertial model (1D and 2D) does not exceed the model timestep.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nChanged depth h for reservoir and lake locations as part of the river local inertial model from bankfull_depth to zero.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nExternal inflow to the SBM + Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D) model configuration.\n\n\n\n\nv0.6.1 - 2022-04-26\n\nFixed\n\nFixed an error with the log file, when writing to a folder that does not (yet) exists. Now, the folder is created prior to writing the log file.\nFixed a MethodError for read_dims, thrown when reading netCDF data with NCDatasets.jl 0.12.3 or higher.\n\n\n\n\nv0.6.0 - 2022-04-14\n\nAdded\n\nThe FLEXTopo model.\nSet a (different) uniform value for each index of input parameters with an extra dimension. A list of values (instead of one uniform value) that should be equal to the length of the extra dimension can be provided in the TOML file. See also Modify parameters.\nModify input parameters with an extra dimension at multiple indices with different scale and offset values, through the TOML file. See also Modify parameters.\nAdded support for netCDF compression for gridded model output, through the option compressionlevel in the [output] section in the TOML file. The setting defaults to 0 (no compression), but all levels between 0 and 9 can be used.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nRe-organized the documentation: moved explanation of different model concepts to a model documentation section, added a user guide to explain setting up the model, added new figures to the description of wflow_sbm.\nThe unit of lateral subsurface flow ssf of LateralSSF is now m^3 d^{-1}. The unit was m^3 t^{-1}, where t is the model timestep. Other flow variables are already stored independently from t, this allows for easier interpretation and to use states independently of t.\nChanged the reference level of water depth h and h_av of 2D overland flow (ShallowWaterLand) for cells containing a river from river bed elevation zb to cell elevation z.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nFixed calculation of average water depth h_av of 2D overland flow (ShallowWaterLand) with the local inertial approach. The summation of h was not correct, resulting in too low values for h_av. For river cells of 2D overland flow h_av was only updated as part of the river domain (ShallowWaterRiver), this value is now also updated as part of the land domain (ShallowWaterLand).\nFixed the following two flow width issues for 2D overland flow of the local inertial model: 1) The flow widths xwidth and ywidth were mapped incorrectly (reversed) to the flow calculation in x and y direction, respectively. 2) For river cells the effective flow width for overland flow was not determined correctly: the riverwidth vector supplied to the function set_effective_flowwidth! covered the complete model domain and should have covered the river domain, resulting in incorrect river widths and thus incorrect effective flow widths for river cells.\n\n\n\n\nv0.5.2 - 2022-02-03\n\nChanged\n\nModel types sbm_gwf and hbv use the same approach for the calculation of the drain width dw as model type sbm.\nRenamed h_bankfull parameter to bankfull_depth for consistency between kinematic-wave and local-inertial river routing. When using the old name under the [input.lateral.river] section of the TOML file, it will work but it is suggested to update the name.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nAdditional log messages and log file as output, see also Logging.\nOption to use the local inertial model for river flow as part of the sbm model type. See also SBM + Local inertial river.\nOption to use the local inertial model for 1D river flow combined with 2D overland flow as part of the sbm model type. See also SBM + Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D).\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nModel type hbv: the surface width for overland flow was not corrected with the river width.\nFixed use of absolute path for path_forcing in TOML file, which gave an error in wflow v0.5.1.\nFixed a crash when glacier processes are simulated as part of the hbv concept (Δt was not defined).\nWhen the surface flow width for overland flow is zero, the water level h of the kinematic wave should not be calculated, otherwise this results in NaN values. When the model is initialized from state files, q and h are set to zero for indices with a zero surface flow width.\nFixed how number of iterations its for kinematic wave river flow are calculated during initialization when using a fixed sub-timestep (specified in the TOML file). For a model timestep smaller than the fixed sub-timestep an InexactError was thrown.\nFixed providing a cyclic parameter when the netCDF variable is read during model initialization with ncread, this gave an error about the size of the netCDF time dimension.\nFixed CSV and netCDF scalar output of variables with dimension layer (SVector).\n\n\n\n\nv0.5.1 - 2021-11-24\n\nFixed\n\nFixed calculation of exfiltwater as part of the sbm_gwf model type. This was based directly on groundwater head above the surface level, without multiplying by the specific_yield, resulting in an overestimation of exfiltwater. This is required since the groundwater model estimates the head by dividing the volume by the specific yield or storativity of the aquifer. So, should the groundwater table rise above surface level, the head above surface level does not represent a water column one to one. (This also means the groundwater model (slightly) overestimates heads when the head rises above the surface level. However, this water is immediately removed, and the head will be set to surface level.)\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nOptional dir_input and dir_output keys in the TOML, which can be used to quickly change the path for all input or output files that are given as a relative path.\n\n\n\n\nv0.5.0 - 2021-11-12\n\nChanged\n\nScaling of potential capillary rise is replaced by a common approach found in literature, based on the water table depth zi, a maximum water depth cap_hmax beyond which capillary rise ceases, and a coefficient cap_n. See also Capillary rise. Multiplying the scaling factor with the ratio of model time step and basetimestep in the original approach resulted in (much) smaller capillary fluxes at sub-daily model time steps compared to daily model time steps, and is not used in the new approach. Parameters cap_hmax and cap_n can be set through the TOML file, parameter capscale of the previous approach is not used anymore.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nConversion of GroundwaterFlow boundaries \\(\\SIb{}{m^3 d^{-1}}\\) as part of model concept sbm_gwf to \\(\\SI{m^3 s^{-1}}\\) for sub-daily model time steps. For the conversion the basetimestep (86400 s) should be used (and not the model time step).\n\n\n\n\nv0.4.1 - 2021-11-04\n\nChanged\n\nThe \\alpha parameter of the kinematic wave has a fixed value now and is not updated because of changes in water height (this could result in large water balance errors). See also Surface routing.\nCyclic input for other structs than vertical are also now supported (for example cyclic inflow to the river).\nMoved update_forcing! and update_cyclic! functions to the run function. It is now easier to implement a custom run function with custom loading of input data (forcing and cyclic parameters).\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nCheck if reservoirs and lakes have downstream nodes. Without downstream nodes is not supported and in that case an error message is thrown that is easier to understand than the previous one: “ArgumentError: Collection is empty, must contain exactly 1 element.”\nFor the input.path_forcing TOML setting we use Glob.jl to expand strings like \"data/forcing-year-*.nc\" to a set of netCDF files that are split in time.\nExternal water inflow (supply/abstractions) added to the kinematic wave inflow in m3/s. It is added/removed to sf.qlat[v] before computing the new q[v] with the kinematic wave equation.\nFixed values for forcing parameters are supported, see also Fixed forcing values.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nOption to use the local inertial model for river flow as part of the SBM + Kinematic wave. See also SBM + Local inertial river.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nRiver inflow for reservoirs and lakes in the kinematic wave. This inflow was based on sf.q[v] at the previous time step, and this has been fixed to the current time step.\n\n\n\n\nv0.4.0 - 2021-09-02\n\nChanged\n\nChanged length units for lateral subsurface flow component from millimeter to meter. This means that state netCDF files from previous versions can only be reused if ssf is divided by 10^9.\nAdd snow and glacier processes to wflow_sbm figure of the documentation.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nMulti-threading of vertical SBM concept and lateral kinematic wave components (overland, river and subsurface flow) of wflow_sbm model SBM + Kinematic wave.\nImproved error message for CSV Reducer.\nThe TOML keys kv₀, θᵣ and θₛ have been replaced with the ASCII versions kv_0, theta_r and theta_s, to avoid encoding issues with certain text editors. The old keys still work as well.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nCalculation of volumetric water content of vertical SBM (soil layers and root zone).\nUpdate of satwaterdepth in SBM (evaporation was only subtracted from a local variable, and not from sbm.satwaterdepth).\nFixed the index lowerlake_ind of NaturalLake. Linked lakes were not simulated correctly (flows between upstream and downstream lake).\nInterpolation function interpolate_linear(x, xp, fp) for CSV tables lakes. When x was larger or smaller than xp, maximum(xp) or minimum(xp) was returned instead of maximum(fp) or minimum(fp).\nFixed model timestep of reservoirs (SimpleReservoir) and lakes (NaturalLake) in relation to precipitation and evapotranspiration fluxes. This was set to the fixed wflow basetimestep of 86400 s, and should be set to the actual model time step from the TOML configuration file.\nAdd flux from Drainage (GroundwaterFlow) in the sbm_gwf_model to the overland flow component instead of the river component of the kinematic wave.\nFixed option constanthead = false (TOML file), constant_head field of GroundwaterFlow was not defined in this case. Fixed this by initializing empty fields (Vector) for struct ConstantHead.\nFixed return max(0, boundary.flux[index]) to return max(0, flux) the flux should be returned when cell is dry, no negative value allowed.\nFixed path to initialize lake to: dirname(static_path)\nFixed outflow = 0, when lake level is below lake threshold. Before a negative value could enter the log function and model would fail.\nFixed the lake storage initialization. For continuation runs (reinit = false), this caused the lake to be reset to the initial conditions instead of the saved state.\n\n\n\n\nv0.3.1 - 2021-05-19\n\nFixed\n\nIgnore extra dimensions in input netCDFs if they are size 1\n\n\n\n\nv0.3.0 - 2021-05-10\n\nChanged\n\nNew deposition process for coarse sediment in the reservoirs with a new parameter restrapefficiency in the sediment model.\nNew variables added to the LandSediment and RiverSediment structs in order to save more output from the sediment model.\nAdded variables volume and inwater to SurfaceFlow struct, this is convenient for the coupling with the water quality model Delwaq.\nRiver water level (h) and discharge (q) forced directly into the RiverSediment struct (instead of using the OverlandFlowSediment struct first).\nRequire Julia 1.6 or later.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nModify model parameters and forcing through the TOML file (see Modify parameters).\nRun wflow_sbm (SBM + kinematic wave) in two parts (until recharge and after subsurface flow) from BMI, including the option to switch off the lateral subsurface component of wflow_sbm.\nSupport more netCDF dimension and axis order variants.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nCorrected a bug in sediment deposition in the river (case when incoming sediment load is more than the river transport capacity).\nFixed update of snow and glacierstore fields of HBV and SBM concepts by the glacier_hbv module.\n\n\n\n\nv0.2.0 - 2021-03-26\n\nChanged\n\nRemoved dependency of the f model parameter of wflow_sbm on the parameters \\theta_{s}, \\theta_{r} and M. This approach is used in Topog_SBM, but not applicable for wflow_sbm. The f parameter needs to be provided as part of the netCDF model parameter file.\nGrid properties as cell length and elevation now stored as part of the model.land.network component and not as part of the vertical model components, as it is not used by these components. altitude (elevation) should now be provided as part of the [input] section of the TOML configuration file, and not as part of the [input.vertical] section.\nRemoved parameter \\theta_{e} from SBM struct (not used in update). Parameters \\theta_{s} and \\theta_{r} included separately (instead of \\theta_{e}) in LateralSSF struct, now directly linked to SBM parameters.\nImprove error messages (netCDF and cyclic flow graph).\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nExport of netCDF scalar timeseries (separate netCDF file from gridded timeseries). This also allows for importing these timeseries by Delft-FEWS (General Adapter).\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nModel parameter Manning’s n now used during the update of the struct SurfaceFlow, to change the related \\alpha parameter of the kinematic wave for channel flow.",

Below, we show how to install wflow from Julia’s package repository and how to install the latest version from GitHub.\nFirst, download and install the current stable release of Julia. If you have any issues installing Julia, please see platform specific instructions for further instructions.\nIf you are new to Julia, it might be a good idea to check out the Getting Started section of the Julia Manual. You can also find additional learning resources at julialang.org/learning.\n\nInstall from Julia’s package repository\nTo access Julia’s package manager, press ] in the Julia REPL. To get back to the Julia REPL, press backspace or ^C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t used Julia in a while, it’s a good idea to run up to update your packages.\npkg&gt; up\n\n\nTo access Julia’s package manager and install wflow, use:\npkg&gt; add Wflow\nThis process can take a while, especially on the first run, as compatible dependencies are automatically resolved and installed from the Pkg General registry.\n\n\nInstall from GitHub\nYou can also install wflow from the master branch on the repository as follows:\npkg&gt; add Wflow#master\nThis command tracks the master branch and updates to the latest commit on that branch when you run update, or simply up, in the Pkg REPL. The add installs wflow in your home directory under .julia/packages/Wflow. Note that packages installed under packages by add should not be changed in the directory, as the change could disrupt Pkg’s automatic dependency handling.\nIf you want to modify any files in the repository, you need to do a development install. This can be done using:\npkg&gt; dev Wflow\nThis will clone the git repository, place it under your home directory in .julia/dev/Wflow, and add the wflow package to your project environment. To receive updates, you’ll need to pull the latest changes manually using git pull.\n\n\nCheck installation of wflow\nFinally, go back to the Julia REPL and try to load wflow:\njulia&gt; using Wflow\nThe first time you do this, it may take longer as any new or changed packages need to be precompiled to enable faster loading on subsequent uses. No error messages should appear, which indicates that you have successfully installed wflow.\nBefore concluding this section, we recommend a few tools that can make using and developing Julia code easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere is a section on editors and IDEs for Julia on https://julialang.org/, scroll down to see it. We use and recommend Microsoft’s free and open source Visual Studio Code. When combined with the Julia extension it provides a powerful and interactive development experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you plan to modify the code of wflow, we recommend installing the Revise.jl package. This package allows you to modify code and use the changes without restarting Julia. Install it with add Revise from the Pkg REPL. Then create a file called .julia/config/startup.jl, and put using Revise there. This will load Revise every time you start a Julia session.",

    "text": "Operational flood forecasting in Australia\nIn Australia, there was a need for high-resolution, fast and accurate rainfall-runoff models to provide boundary conditions for a fast and detailed flood inundation model (SFINCS). The domain of the flood model covers the entire North and East Coast of Australia. Although many gauging stations are available to provide real-time information, many rivers are not covered. For these locations, wflow_sbm models are used to provide this real-time information. Additionally, these models are used to provide projections for potential future scenarios. Using the HydroMT library, all wflow_sbm models were automatically built. The high level of flexibility in spatial and temporal resolution, combined with the physics-based nature of the concept, makes Wflow_sbm particularly suitable for ungauged basins. Furthermore, the model is detailed and computationally efficient enough for coupling with the fast flood inundation model SFINCS.\n\nThe results of this proof of concept are very promising. Technically, we were able to quickly set up the wflow_sbm models, couple them to the flood inundation models (SFINCS), and run the models operationally under the Delft-FEWS platform. Model validation was conducted for two basins by comparing the results of Wflow_sbm against observations and the results of calibrated URBS models. This validation demonstrated that the uncalibrated Wflow_sbm model results were already quite satisfactory, especially given the complex nature of these basins, which include several small and large reservoirs. We could also show the potential for further calibration by adjusting the KsatHorFrac parameter.\nDe Kleermaeker, S., Leijnse, T., Morales, Y., Druery, C., & Maguire, S. (2022).

    "section": "Simulating plastic transport in Thailand",
    "text": "Simulating plastic transport in Thailand\nFor the Pollution Control Board of the Government of Thailand and the World Bank, we supported a material flow analysis of plastics in Thailand using wflow. Plastic pollution is a growing global issue. Plastic waste enters rivers and is transported to the ocean where it persists and threatens the health of the ocean, seas and coasts. The initial movement of plastic waste is in many cases triggered by runoff from (heavy) rainfall and transported by water flow towards small streams and rivers. Therefore there is strong relation to rainfall-runoff processes, which can be modeled using high-resolution rainfall-runoff models.\nIn this study we applied the wflow_sbm model in combination with a fate-and-transport and water quality model (DelWaq) to simulate the movement of plastics through five large river basins and on three island and coastal zones (Krabi, Phuket, and Ko Samui; see screenshot of the model below) in Thailand. Together with our partners Panya Consultants and HII, we were able to identify hotspots of plastic pollution, estimate how much plastic waste would end up in the Gulf of Thailand and recommend priority areas for reducing plastic waste reaching the sea.\n\nThe wflow_sbm models for the five large basins were calibrated. The presence of large dams and reservoirs complicated calibration, but with the input for the dam operation, the model performance for these basins could be largely improved. The figure below shows the calibrated model results for the Chao Phraya, just upstream of Bangkok. The input from the hydrological wflow_sbm model was used as input for the fate and transport model to assess the amount of plastic transported to the ocean.\n\nLink to World Bank report: https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/publication/plastic-waste-material-flow-analysis-for-thailand",

    "section": "Aquifer types",
    "text": "Aquifer types\nGroundwater flow can occur either in a confined or unconfined aquifer. Confined aquifers are overlain by a poorly permeable confining layer (e.g. clay). No air can get in to fill the pore space so that the aquifer always remains fully saturated. For a confined aquifer, water will always flow along the complete height \\(\\SIb{H}{m}\\) over the aquifer and transmissivity \\(\\SIb{kH}{m^2 d^{-1}}\\) is a constant (\\(\\SIb{k}{m d^{-1}}\\) is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity). Specific storage is the amount of water an aquifer releases per unit change in hydraulic head, per unit volume of aquifer, as the aquifer and the groundwater itself is compressed. Its value is much smaller than specific yield, between \\(10^{-5}\\) (stiff) and \\(10^{-2}\\) (weak).\nThe upper boundary of an unconfined aquifer is the water table (the phreatic surface). Specific yield (or drainable porosity) represents the volumetric fraction the aquifer will yield when all water drains and the pore volume is filled by air instead. Specific yield will vary roughly between \\(0.05\\) (clay) and \\(0.45\\) (peat) (Johnson, 1967).\nGroundwater flow is solved forward in time and central in space. The vertically averaged governing equation for an inhomogeneous and isotropic aquifer in one dimension can be written as:\n\\[\n    S \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} =  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(kH \\frac{\\phi}{\\delta x}\\right) + Q\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{S}{m m^{-1}}\\) is storativity (or specific yield), \\(\\SIb{\\phi}{m}\\) is hydraulic head, \\(t\\) is time, \\(\\SIb{k}{m t^{-1}}\\) is horizontal hydraulic conductivity, \\(\\SIb{H}{m}\\) is the (saturated) aquifer height: groundwater level - aquifer bottom elevation and \\(\\SIb{Q}{m\nt^{-1}}\\) represents fluxes from boundary conditions (e.g. recharge or abstraction), see also Aquifer boundary conditions.\nThe simplest finite difference formulation is forward in time, central in space, and can be written as:\n\\[\n    S_i  \\frac{\\phi_{i}^{t+1} - \\phi_i^{t}}{\\Delta t} = -C_{i-1}  (\\phi_{i-1} - \\phi_i) - C_i  (\\phi_{i+1} - \\phi_i) + Q_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(i\\) is the cell index, \\(t\\) is time, \\(\\Delta t\\) is the step size, \\(C_{i-1}\\) is the the intercell conductance between cell \\(i-1\\) and \\(i\\) and \\(C_i\\) is the intercell conductance between cell \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\). The connection data between cells is stored as part of the Connectivity struct, see also Connectivity for more information.\nConductance \\(C\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{kH w}{l}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{w}{m}\\) is the width of the cell to cell connection, and \\(\\SIb{l}{m}\\) is the length of the cell to cell connection. \\(k\\) and \\(H\\) may both vary in space; intercell conductance is therefore an average using the properties of two cells. For the calculation of the intercell conductance \\(C\\) the harmonic mean is used (see also Goode and Appel, 1992), here between cell index \\(i\\) and cell index \\(i+1\\), in the \\(x\\) direction:\n\\[\n    C_i = w  \\frac{k_iH_i\\cdot k_{i+1}H_{i+1}}{k_iH_i \\cdot l_{i+1} + k_{i+1}H_{i+1} \\cdot l_i}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{H}{m}\\) is the aquifer top - aquifer bottom, and \\(k\\), \\(l_i\\) is the length in cell \\(i\\) (\\(0.5 \\Delta x_i\\)), \\(l_{i+1}\\) is the length in cell \\(i+1\\) (\\(0.5 \\Delta x_{i+1}\\)) and \\(w\\) as previously defined. For an unconfined aquifer the intercell conductance is scaled by using the “upstream saturated fraction” as the MODFLOW documentation calls it. In this approach, the saturated thickness of a cell-to-cell is approximated using the cell with the highest head. This results in a consistent overestimation of the saturated thickness, but it avoids complexities related with cell drying and rewetting, such as having to define a “wetting threshold” or a “wetting factor”. See also the documentation for MODFLOW-NWT (Niswonger et al., 1) or MODFLOW6 (Langevin et al., 2017) for more background information. For more background on drying and rewetting, see for example McDonald et al. (1991).\nFor the finite difference formulation, there is only one unknown, \\(\\phi_i^{t+1}\\). Reshuffling terms:\n\\[\n\\phi_i^{t+1} = \\phi_i^t + (C_{i-1}  (\\phi_i - \\phi_{i-1}) + C_i  (\\phi_{i+1} - \\phi_i) + Q_i) \\frac{Δt}{S_i}\n\\]\nThis can be generalized to two dimensions, for both regular and irregular cell connectivity. Finally, a stable time step size can be computed given the forward-in-time, central in space scheme, based on the following criterion from Chu and Willis (1984):\n\\[\n  \\frac{\\Delta t k H}{\\Delta x  \\Delta y S}  \\le \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{\\Delta t}{d}\\) is the stable time step size, \\(\\SIb{\\Delta x}{m}\\) is the cell length in the \\(x\\) direction and \\(\\SIb{\\Delta y}{m}\\) is the cell length in the \\(y\\) direction, \\(\\SIb{k}{m^2 d^{-1}}\\) is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and \\(\\SIb{H}{m}\\) is the saturated thickness of the aquifer. For each cell \\(\\frac{\\Delta x  \\Delta y S}{k H}\\) is calculated, the minimum of these values is determined, and multiplied by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), to get the stable time step size.\nFor more details about the finite difference formulation and the stable time step size criterion we refer to the paper of Chu and Willis (1984).\nBoundary conditions can be classified into three categories:\n\nspecified head (Dirichlet)\nspecified flux (Neumann)\nhead-dependent flux (Robin)\n\nNeumann and Robin conditions are implemented by adding to or subtracting from a net (lumped) cell flux. Dirichlet conditions are special cased, since they cannot (easily) be implemented via the flux, but the head is set directly instead.",

Subscript \\(i-\\frac{1}{2}\\) is to the link between node \\(i\\) and \\(i-1\\), subscript \\(i+\\frac{1}{2}\\) is the link between node \\(i\\) and node \\(i+1\\), and subscript \\(i-\\frac{3}{2}\\) is the link between node \\(i-1\\) and node \\(i-2\\). \\(\\SIb{Q}{m^3 s^{-1}}\\) is the water discharge, \\(\\SIb{\\eta}{m}\\) is the water surface elevation, \\(\\SIb{h_f}{m}\\) is the water depth between cells, \\(\\SIb{n}{m^{-\\frac{1}{3}} s}\\) is the Manning’s roughness coefficient, \\(\\SIb{g}{m s^{-2}}\\) is acceleration due to gravity, \\(\\SIb{\\Delta t}{s}\\) is the adaptive model time step, \\(\\SIb{\\Delta\nx}{m}\\) is the distance between two cells and \\(\\SIb{\\Delta y}{m}\\) is the flow width. Below the staggered grid and variables of the numerical solution in the x-direction, based on Almeida et al. (2012):\n\nThe overland flow local inertial approach is used in combination with the local inertial river routing. This is a similar to the modelling approach of Neal et al. (2012), where the hydraulic model LISFLOOD-FP was extended with a subgrid channel model. For the subgrid channel, Neal et al. (2012) make use of a D4 (four direction) scheme, while here a D8 (eight direction) scheme is used, in combination with the D4 scheme for 2D overland flow.\nIn the TOML file the following properties related to the local inertial model with 1D river routing and 2D overland flow can be provided for the sbm model type:\n[model]\nland_routing = \"local-inertial\"  # default is kinematic-wave\nriver_routing = \"local-inertial\" # default is kinematic-wave\ninertial_flow_alpha = 0.5        # alpha coefficient for model stability (default = 0.7)\nfroude_limit = true              # default is true, limit flow to subcritical-critical according to Froude number\nh_thresh = 0.1                   # water depth [m] threshold for calculating flow between cells (default = 1e-03)\nThe properties inertial_flow_alpha, froude_limit and h_thresh apply to 1D river routing as well as 2D overland flow. The properties inertial_flow_alpha and froude_limit, and the adaptive model time step \\(\\Delta t\\) are explained in more detail in the River and floodplain routing section of the local inertial model.",

The internal slope model parameter slope is set through the TOML file as follows:\n[input.lateral.land]\nslope = \"Slope\"\nThe parameter kh_0 is computed by multiplying the vertical hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface kv_0 (including unit conversion) of the vertical SBM concept with the internal parameter khfrac [-] (default value of 1.0).

    "text": "Rainfall interception\nTwo different interception models are available: the analytical Gash model, and the modified Rutter model. The simulation timestep defines which interception model is used, where daily (or larger) timesteps use the Gash model, and timesteps smaller than daily use the modified Rutter model.\n\nThe analytical (Gash) model (Gash, 1979)\nThe analytical model of rainfall interception is based on Rutter’s numerical model. Simplifications allow the model to be applied on a daily basis, although a storm-based approach will yield better results in situations with more than one storm per day. The amount of water needed to completely saturate the canopy is defined as:\n\\[\n    P'=\\frac{-\\overline{R}S}{\\overline{E}_{w}}\\log\\left[1-\\frac{\\overline{E}_{w}}{\\overline{R}}(1-p-p_{t})^{-1}\\right]\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\overline{R}\\) is the average precipitation intensity on a saturated canopy and \\(\\overline{E}_{w}\\) the average evaporation from the wet canopy and with the vegetation parameters \\(S\\), \\(p\\) and \\(p_t\\) as defined previously. The model uses a series of expressions to calculate the interception loss during different phases of a storm. An analytical integration of the total evaporation and rainfall under saturated canopy conditions is performed for each storm to determine average values of \\(\\overline{E}_{w}\\) and \\(\\overline{R}\\). The total evaporation from the canopy (the total interception loss) is calculated as the sum of the components listed in the table below. Interception losses from the stems are calculated for days with \\(P\\geq S_{t}/p_{t}\\). \\(p_t\\) and \\(S_t\\) are small and neglected.\n\nFormulation of the components of interception loss according to Gash:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\nInterception loss\n\n\n\n\nFor \\(m\\) small storms (\\(P_{g}&lt;{P'}_{g}\\))\n\\((1-p-p_{t})\\sum_{j=1}^{m}P_{g,j}\\)\n\n\nWetting up the canopy in \\(n\\) large storms (\\(P_{g}\\geq{P'}_{g}\\))\n\\(n(1-p-p_{t}){P'}_{g}-nS\\)\n\n\nEvaporation from saturated canopy during rainfall\n\\(\\overline{E}/\\overline{R}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(P_{g,j}-{P'}_{g})\\)\n\n\nEvaporation after rainfall ceases for \\(n\\) large storms\n\\(nS\\)\n\n\nEvaporation from trunks in \\(q\\) storms that fill the trunk storage\n\\(qS_{t}\\)\n\n\nEvaporation from trunks in \\(m+n-q\\) storms that do not fill the trunk storage\n\\(p_{t}\\sum_{j=1}^{m+n-q}P_{g,j}\\)\n\n\n\nIn applying the analytical model, saturated conditions are assumed to occur when the hourly rainfall exceeds a certain threshold. Often a threshold of 0.5 mm/hr is used. \\(\\overline{R}\\) is calculated for all hours when the rainfall exceeds the threshold to give an estimate of the mean rainfall rate onto a saturated canopy.\nGash (1979) has shown that in a regression of interception loss on rainfall (on a storm basis) the regression coefficient should equal to \\(\\overline{E}_w/\\overline{R}\\). Assuming that neither \\(\\overline{E}_w\\) nor \\(\\overline{R}\\) vary considerably in time, \\(\\overline{E}_w\\) can be estimated in this way from \\(\\overline{R}\\) in the absence of above-canopy climatic observations. Values derived in this way generally tend to be (much) higher than those calculated with the penman-monteith equation.\n\n\nThe modified rutter model\nFor sub daily timesteps the interception is calculated using a simplification of the Rutter model. The simplified model is solved explicitly and does not take drainage from the canopy into account. The amount of stemflow is taken as a fraction (0.1 * canopygapfraction) of the precipitation. Throughfall equals to the amount of water that cannot be stored by the canopy, plus the rainfall that is not captured by the canopy. Water can evaporate from the canopy storage, taken as the minimum between potential evaporation and the current storage. The “left-over” potential evaporation (if any) is returned as output.\nWflow.rainfall_interception_modrut\n\n\nInterception parameters from LAI\nThe SBM concept can determine the interception parameters from leaf area index (LAI) climatology. In order to switch this on you must define this cyclic parameter in the TOML file, the parameter is read from path_static, as follows:\n[input]\npath_forcing = \"data/forcing-moselle.nc\"\npath_static = \"data/staticmaps-moselle.nc\"\n\ncyclic = [\"vertical.leaf_area_index\"]\nFurthermore, these additional parameters are required: + Specific leaf storage (sl \\SIb{}{mm}) + Storage woody part of vegetation (swood \\SIb{}{mm}) + Extinction coefficient (kext \\SIb{}{-})\nHere it is assumed that cmax \\SIb{}{mm} (leaves) (canopy storage capacity for the leaves only) relates linearly with LAI (c.f. Van Dijk and Bruijnzeel 2001). This is done via the sl. sl can be determined through a lookup table with land cover based on literature (Pitman 1989, Lui 1998). Next the cmax (leaves) is determined using:\n\\[\n    c_{\\max}(\\mathrm{leaves})  = \\mathrm{sl} \\cdot \\mathrm{LAI}\n\\]\nTo get to total storage (cmax) the woody part of the vegetation also needs to be added. As for sl, the storage of the woody part swood can also be related to land cover (lookup table).\nThe canopy gap fraction is determined using the extinction coefficient kext (van Dijk and Bruijnzeel 2001):\n\\[\n    \\mathrm{canopygapfraction} = \\exp(-\\subtext{k}{ext} \\cdot \\mathrm{LAI})\n\\]\nThe extinction coefficient kext can be related to land cover.",

    "section": "Evaporation",
    "text": "Evaporation\nThe wflow_sbm model assumes the input to be potential reference evapotranspiration. A crop coefficient (kc, set to 1 by default) is used to convert the potential evapotranspiration rate of a reference crop fully covering the soil to the potential evapotranspiration rate of vegetation (natural and agricultural) fully covering the soil. The crop coefficient kc of wflow_sbm is used for a surface completely covered by vegetation, and does not include the effect of growing stages of vegetation and soil cover. These effects are handled separately through the use of the canopy gap fraction.\nIt is assumed that the potential evaporation rate of intercepted water by vegetation is equal to the potential evapotranspiration rate of vegetation (fully covering the soil) multiplied by the canopy fraction. The potential evapotranspiration rate left over after interception is available for transpiration. For potential open water evaporation (river and water bodies) the potential reference evapotranspiration rate is used (multipled by the river fraction riverfrac, and open water fraction waterfrac). Also for potential soil evaporation the potential reference evapotranspiration rate is used, multiplied by the canopy gap fraction corrected by the sum of total water fraction (riverfrac and waterfrac) and the fraction covered by a glacier (glacierfrac).\n\nBare soil evaporation\nIf there is only one soil layer present in the wflow_sbm model, the bare soil evaporation is scaled according to the wetness of the soil layer. The fraction of bare soil is assumed to be equal to the fraction not covered by the canopy (canopygapfraction) corrected by the total water fraction. When the soil is fully saturated, evaporation is set to equal the potential reference evaporation. When the soil is not fully saturated, actual evaporation decreases linearly with decreasing soil moisture values, as indicated by the figure below.\n\n\n\nEvaporation reduction as function of available soil moisture\n\n\n\nWhen more soil layers are present, soil evaporation is only provided from the upper soil layer, and soil evaporation is split in evaporation from the unsaturated store and evaporation from the saturated store. Water is first evaporated from the unsaturated store. The remaining potential soil evaporation can be used for evaporation from the saturated store, but only when the water table is present in the upper soil layer. Both the evaporation from the unsaturated store and the evaporation from the saturated store are limited by the minimum of the remaining potential soil evaporation and the available water in the unsaturated/saturated zone of the upper soil layer. Also for multiple soil layers, the evaporation (both unsaturated and saturated) decreases linearly with decreasing water availability.\n\n\nTranspiration\nThe maximum possible root water extraction rate for each soil layer is determined by partitioning the potential transpiration rate T_p based on the fraction of the total root length (rootfraction \\SIb{}{-}) in each soil layer. A root water uptake reduction model is used to calculate a reduction coefficient as a function of soil water pressure, that may reduce the maximum possible root water extraction rate. The root water uptake reduction model is based on the concept proposed by Feddes et al. (1978). This concept defines a reduction coefficient \\SIb{\\alpha}{-} as a function of soil water pressure (\\SIb{h}{cm}). Four different levels of h are defined: h1, h2, h3 and h4. h1 represents anoxic moisture conditions, h2 represents field capacity, h3 represents the point of critical soil moisture content (onset of drought stress), and h4 represents the wilting point. The value of h3 is a function of the potential transpiration rate, between \\SIb{1}{mm d^{-1}} and \\SIb{5}{mm d^{-1}}. If T_p \\le \\SIb{1}{mm d^{-1}}, h3 is set equal to h3_low (input model parameter). If T_p \\ge \\SIb{5}{mm d^{-1}}, h3 is set equal to h3_high (input model parameter). For T_p values between \\SIb{1}{mm d^{-1}} and \\SIb{5}{mm d^{-1}}, the value of h3 is linearly related to T_p (between h3_low and h3_high). Besides model parameters h3_high and h3_low, the critical pressure heads h1, h2 and h4 can be defined as input to the model.\nThe current soil water pressure is determined following the concept defined by Brooks and Corey (1964):\n\\[\n    \\frac{\\theta-\\theta_r}{\\theta_s-\\theta_r} =  \\min\\left\\{1, \\left(\\frac{h_b}{h}\\right)^\\lambda\\right\\}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{h}{cm}\\) is the pressure head, \\(\\SIb{h_b}{cm}\\) is the air entry pressure head, and \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\theta_s\\), \\(\\theta_r\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) as previously defined.\nWhenever the current soil water pressure drops below h4, the root water uptake is set to zero. The root water uptake is at ideal conditions whenever the soil water pressure is above h3, with a linear transition between h3 and h4. The assumption that very wet conditions do not affect root water uptake too much is probably generally applicable to natural vegetation. For crops this assumption is not valid and in this case root water uptake above h1 should be set to zero (oxygen deficit) and between h1 and h2 root water uptake is limited. This is possible by setting the input model parameter alpha_h1 at 0 (default is 1).\n\n\n\nRoot water uptake reduction coefficient as a function of soil water pressure\n\n\n\nThe maximum allowed root water extraction from each soil layer in the unsaturated zone is determined based on the fraction of each soil layer in the unsaturated zone that is above the rooting depth (availcap) and the unsaturated storage usld, see conceptual figure below. This is implemented using the following code (i refers to the index of the vector that contains all active cells within the spatial model domain and k refers to the soil layer (from top to bottom) in the unsaturated zone):\n  # availcap is fraction of soil layer containing roots\n  # if `ust` is `true`, the whole unsaturated store is available for transpiration\n  if ust\n      availcap = usld[k] * 0.99\n  else\n      availcap =\n          min(1.0, max(0.0, (sbm.rootingdepth[i] - sbm.sumlayers[i][k]) / usl[k]))\n  end\n  maxextr = usld[k] * availcap\n\n\n\nConceptual overview of how maxextr depends on rooting depth and water table depth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen whole_ust_available is set to true in the TOML file, almost the complete unsaturated storage (99%) is available for transpiration, independent of the rootingdepth.\n[model]\nwhole_ust_available = true\n\n\nThe computation of transpiration from the saturated store depends on the water table depth, rooting depth, the reduction coefficient \\(\\alpha\\), the fraction of wet roots and the rootfraction below the water table. The fraction of wet roots is determined using a sigmoid fuction (see figure below). The parameter rootdistpar defines the sharpness of the transition between fully wet and fully dry roots. If the water table depth is equal to or lower than the rooting depth, the remaining potential transpiration is used based on the potential transpiration and actual transpiration in the unsaturated zone. The remaining potential transpiration is multiplied by the wet roots fraction and the reduction coefficient (and limited by the available water in saturated zone) to get the transpiration from the saturated part of the soil. If the water table depth intersects the rooting depth, the potential transpiration is multiplied by the remaining rootfraction (below the water table), wet roots fraction and the reduction coefficient (and limited by the available water in saturated zone) to get the transpiration from the saturated part of the soil. This is implemented using the following code (i refers to the index of the vector that contains all active cells within the spatial model domain):\n# transpiration from saturated store\nwetroots = scurve(sbm.zi[i], sbm.rootingdepth[i], Float(1.0), sbm.rootdistpar[i])\nalpha = rwu_reduction_feddes(\n    Float(0.0),\n    sbm.h1[i],\n    sbm.h2[i],\n    sbm.h3[i],\n    sbm.h4[i],\n    sbm.alpha_h1[i],\n)\n# include remaining root fraction if rooting depth is below water table zi\nif sbm.zi[i] &gt;= sbm.rootingdepth[i]\n    f_roots = wetroots\n    restevap = sbm.pottrans[i] - actevapustore\nelse\n    f_roots = wetroots * (1.0 - rootfraction_unsat)\n    restevap = sbm.pottrans[i]\nend\nactevapsat = min(restevap * f_roots * alpha, satwaterdepth)\nsatwaterdepth = satwaterdepth - actevapsat\n\n\n\nAmount of wet roots and the effect of the rootdistpar parameter",

Briefly: the soil is considered as a bucket with a certain depth (\\(\\SIb{z_t}{mm}\\)), divided into a saturated store (\\(\\SIb{S}{mm}\\)) and an unsaturated store (\\(\\SIb{U}{mm}\\)). The top of the \\(S\\) store forms a pseudo-water table at depth \\(\\SIb{z_{i}}{mm}\\) such that the value of \\(S\\) at any time is given by:\n\\[\n    S=(z_t-z_i)(\\theta_s-\\theta_r)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{\\theta_{s}}{-}\\) and \\(\\SIb{\\theta_{r}}{-}\\) are the saturated and residual soil water contents, respectively.\nThe unsaturated store \\(U\\) is subdivided into storage (\\(\\SIb{U_s}{mm}\\)) and deficit (\\(\\SIb{U_d}{m}\\)):\n\\[\n    U_d=(\\theta_s-\\theta_r)z_i-U\\\\\n    U_s=U-U_d\n\\]\nThe saturation deficit (\\(\\SIb{S_d}{mm}\\)) for the soil profile as a whole is defined as:\n\\[\n    S_d=(\\theta_s-\\theta_r)z_t-S\n\\]\nAll infiltrating water that enters the \\(U\\) store first. The unsaturated layer can be split-up in different layers, by providing the thickness \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\) of the layers in the TOML file. The following example specifies three layers (from top to bottom) of 100, 300 and 800 mm:\n[model]\nthicknesslayers = [100, 300, 800]\nThe code checks for each grid cell the specified layers against the soilthickness \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\), and adds or removes (partly) layer(s) based on the soilthickness.\nAssuming a unit head gradient, the transfer of water (\\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{st}}{mm t^{-1}}\\)) from a \\(\\SIb{U}{mm}\\) store layer is controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{K}{sat}}{mm t^{-1}}\\) at depth \\(\\SIb{z}{mm}\\) (bottom layer) or \\(\\SIb{z_i}{mm}\\), the effective saturation degree of the layer, and a Brooks-Corey power coefficient (parameter \\(c\\)) based on the pore size distribution index \\(\\lambda\\) (Brooks and Corey, 1964):\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n    \\mathrm{st}=\\subtext{K}{sat}\\left(\\frac{\\theta-\\theta_r}{\\theta_s-\\theta_r}\\right)^c\\\\\n    c=\\frac{2+3\\lambda}{\\lambda}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nHere \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\) denotes milimeter per time step.\nWhen the unsaturated layer is not split-up into different layers, it is possible to use the original Topog\\_SBM vertical transfer formulation, by specifying in the TOML file:\n[model]\ntransfermethod = true\nThe transfer of water from the \\(\\SIb{U}{mm}\\) store to the \\(\\SIb{S}{mm}\\) store (\\(\\SIb{st}{mm\nt^{-1}}\\)) is in that case controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{K}{sat}}{mm s^{-1}}\\) at depth \\(\\SIb{z_i}{mm}\\) and the ratio between \\(\\SIb{U}{mm}\\) and \\(\\SIb{S_d}{mm}\\):\n\\[\n    \\mathrm{st}=\\subtext{K}{sat}\\frac{U_s}{S_d}\n\\]\nFour different saturated hydraulic conductivity depth profiles (ksat_profile) are available and a ksat_profile can be specified in the TOML file as follows:\n[input.vertical]\nksat_profile = \"exponential_constant\" # optional, one of (\"exponential\", \"exponential_constant\", \"layered\", \"layered_exponential\"), default is \"exponential\"\nSoil measurements are often available for about the upper \\(\\SI{1.5-2}{m}\\) of the soil column to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity, while these measurements are often lacking for soil depths beyond \\(\\SI{1.5-2}{m}\\).

Infiltration is determined separately for the compacted and non-compacted areas, as these have different infiltration capacities. Naturally, only the water that can be stored in the soil can infiltrate. If not all water can infiltrate, this is added as excess water to the runoff routing scheme.\nThe infiltrating water is split in two parts, the part that falls on compacted areas and the part that falls on non-compacted areas. The maximum amount of water that can infiltrate in these areas is calculated by taking the minimum of the maximum infiltration rate (infiltcapsoil \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\) for non-compacted areas and infiltcappath \\(\\SIb{}{mm\nt^{-1}}\\) for compacted areas) and the amount of water available for infiltration avail_forinfilt \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\). The water that can actually infiltrate infiltsoilpath \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\) is calculated by taking the minimum of the total maximum infiltration rate (compacted and non-compacted areas) and the remaining storage capacity.\nInfiltration excess occurs when the infiltration capacity is smaller then the throughfall and stemflow rate. This amount of water (infiltexcess \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\)) becomes overland flow (infiltration excess overland flow). Saturation excess occurs when the (upper) soil becomes saturated and water cannot infiltrate anymore. This amount of water excesswater \\(\\SIb{}{mm\nt^{-1}}\\) becomes overland flow (saturation excess overland flow).\n\nInfiltration in frozen soils\nIf snow processes are modelled, the infiltration capacity is reduced when the soil is frozen (or near freezing point). A infiltration correction factor is defined as a S-curve with the shape as defined below. A parameter (cf_soil) defines the base factor of infiltration when the soil is frozen. The soil temperature is calculated based on the soil temperature on the previous timestep, and the temperature difference between air and soil temperature weighted with a factor (w_soil, which defaults to 0.1125).\nThe near surface soil temperature is modelled using a simple equation (Wigmosta et al., 2009):\n\\[\nT_s^t = T_s^{t-1} + w  (T_a - T_s^{t-1})\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{T_s^{t}}{\\degree C}\\) is the near-surface soil temperature at time \\(t\\), \\(\\SIb{T_a}{\\degree C}\\) is air temperature and \\(\\SIb{w}{-}\\) is a weighting coefficient determined through calibration (default is 0.1125 for daily timesteps).\nA reduction factor (cf_soil \\(\\SIb{}{-}\\), default is 0.038) is applied to the maximum infiltration rate (infiltcapsoil and infiltcappath), when the following model settings are specified in the TOML file:\n[model]\nsoilinfreduction = true\nsnow = true\nIf soilinfreduction is set to false, water is allowed to infiltrate the soil, even if the soil is frozen.\nA S-curve (see plot below) is used to make a smooth transition (a c-factor (\\(c\\)) of 8.0 is used):\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n    b = \\frac{1.0}{1.0 - \\subtext{\\mathrm{cf}}{soil}}\\\\\n    \\mathrm{soilinfredu} = \\frac{1.0}{b + \\exp(-c (T_s - a))} + \\subtext{\\mathrm{cf}}{soil}\\\\\n    a = 0.0\\\\\n    c = 8.0\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\n\n\nInfiltration correction factor as a function of soil temperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapillary rise\nThe actual capillary rise actcapflux \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\) is determined using the following approach: first the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\) is determined at the water table \\(z_i\\); next a potential capillary rise maxcapflux \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\) is determined from the minimum of ksat, actual transpiration actevapustore \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\) taken from the \\(U\\) store, available water in the \\(S\\) store (satwaterdepth \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\)) and the deficit of the \\(U\\) store (ustorecapacity \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\)), as shown by the following code block:\nmaxcapflux = max(0.0, min(ksat, actevapustore, ustorecapacity, satwaterdepth))\nThen the potential rise maxcapflux is scaled using the water table depth zi, a maximum water depth cap_hmax \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\) beyond which capillary rise ceases and a coefficient cap_n \\(\\SIb{}{-}\\), as follows in the code block below (i refers to the index of the vector that contains all active cells within the spatial model domain):\nif sbm.zi[i] &gt; rootingdepth\n    capflux =\n        maxcapflux * pow(\n            1.0 - min(sbm.zi[i], sbm.cap_hmax[i]) / (sbm.cap_hmax[i]),\n            sbm.cap_n[i],\n        )\nelse\n    capflux = 0.0\nend\nIf the roots reach the water table (rootingdepth \\(\\ge\\) sbm.zi), capflux is set to zero.\nFinally, the capillary rise capflux is limited by the unsaturated store deficit (one or multiple layers), calculated as follows in the code block below (i refers to the index of the vector that contains all active cells within the spatial model domain, and k refers to the layer position):\nusl[k] * (sbm.theta_s[i] - sbm.theta_r[i]) - usld[k]\nwhere usl \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\) is the unsaturated layer thickness, usld is the ustorelayerdepth \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\) (amount of water in the unsaturated layer), and \\(\\theta_s\\) and \\(\\theta_r\\) as previously defined.\nThe calculation of the actual capillary rise actcapflux is as follows in the code block below (i refers to the index of the vector that contains all active cells within the spatial model domain, and k refers to the layer position):\nactcapflux = 0.0\nnetcapflux = capflux\nfor k = n_usl:-1:1\n    toadd =\n        min(netcapflux, max(usl[k] * (sbm.theta_s[i] - sbm.theta_r[i]) - usld[k], 0.0))\n    usld = setindex(usld, usld[k] + toadd, k)\n    netcapflux = netcapflux - toadd\n    actcapflux = actcapflux + toadd\nend\nIn case of multiple unsaturated layers (n_usl \\(&gt;\\) 1), the calculation of the actual capillary rise starts at the lowest unsaturated layer while keeping track of the remaining capillary rise netcapflux \\(\\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}\\).\n\n\nLeakage\nIf the maxleakage \\(\\SIb{}{mm day^{-1}}\\) input model parameter is set &gt; 0, water is lost from the saturated zone and runs out of the model.",

Finally, for allocation areas the water demand \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{V}{gw,demand}}{m^3}\\) and availability \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{V}{gw, availabilty}}{m^3}\\) are summed, and the total groundwater abstraction is then:\n\\[\n    \\subtext{V}{gw, abstraction} = \\min(\\subtext{V}{gw, demand}, \\subtext{V}{gw, availabilty})\n\\] The fraction of available groundwater that can be abstracted at allocation area level \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{f}{gw, abstraction}}{-}\\) at the allocation area level is then:\n\\[\n    \\subtext{f}{gw, abstraction} = \\frac{\\subtext{V}{gw, abstraction}}{\\subtext{V}{gw, available}}\n\\] This fraction is applied to the remaining available groundwater of each land cell to compute groundwater abstraction and to update the local groundwater abstraction.\nThe fraction of water demand that can be satisfied by available groundwater \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{f}{gw,allocation}}{-}\\) at the allocation area level is then:\n\\[\n    \\subtext{f}{gw, allocation} = \\frac{\\subtext{V}{gw, abstraction}}{\\subtext{V}{gw, demand}}\n\\] This fraction is applied to the remaining groundwater demand of each land cell to compute the allocated groundwater to each land cell.\n\n\nAbstractions\nGroundwater abstraction is implemented by subtracting this amount from the recharge variable of the lateral subsurface flow component (kinematic wave) or the recharge rate of the groundwater flow module. Surface water abstraction \\(\\SIb{}{m^3 s^{-1}}\\) is divided by the flow length dl \\(\\SIb{}{m}\\) and subtracted from the lateral inflow of kinematic wave routing scheme for river flow. For the local inertial routing scheme (river and optional floodplain routing), the surface water abstraction \\(\\SIb{}{m^3 s^{-1}}\\) is subtracted as part of the continuity equation of the local inertial model. For reservoir and lake locations surface water is abstracted (act_surfacewater_abst_vol \\(\\SIb{}{m^3 s^{-1}}\\)) from the reservoir volume \\(\\SIb{}{m^3}\\) and lake storage \\(\\SIb{}{m^3}\\) respectively, with a subsequent update of the lake waterlevel \\(\\SIb{}{m}\\).",

    "text": "Rainfall interception\nBoth the Gash and Rutter models are available to estimate rainfall interception by the vegetation. The selection of an interception model depends on the simulation timestep.\n\nThe analytical (Gash) model\nThe analytical model of rainfall interception is based on Rutter’s numerical model. The simplifications that introduced allow the model to be applied on a daily basis, although a storm-based approach will yield better results in situations with more than one storm per day. The amount of water needed to completely saturate the canopy is defined as:\n\\[\nP'=\\frac{-\\overline{R}S}{\\overline{E}_w}\\log\\left[1-\\frac{\\overline{E}_w}{\\overline{R}}(1-p-p_t)^{-1}\\right]\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\overline{R}\\) is the average precipitation intensity on a saturated canopy and \\(\\overline{E}_{w}\\) the average evaporation from the wet canopy and with the vegetation parameters \\(S\\), \\(p\\) and \\(p_t\\) as defined previously. The model uses a series of expressions to calculate the interception loss during different phases of a storm. An analytical integration of the total evaporation and rainfall under saturated canopy conditions is then done for each storm to determine average values of \\(\\overline{E}_{w}\\) and \\(\\overline{R}\\). The total evaporation from the canopy (the total interception loss) is calculated as the sum of the components listed in the table below. Interception losses from the stems are calculated for days with \\(P\\geq S_{t}/p_{t}\\). \\(p_t\\) and \\(S_t\\) are small and neglected.\n\nFormulation of the components of interception loss according to Gash:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\nInterception loss\n\n\n\n\nFor \\(m\\) small storms (\\(P_g&lt;{P'}_g\\))\n\\((1-p-p_t)\\sum_{j=1}^m P_{g,j}\\)\n\n\nWetting up the canopy in \\(n\\) large storms (\\(P_g\\geq{P'}_g\\))\n\\(n(1-p-p_{t}){P'}_g-nS\\)\n\n\nEvaporation from saturated canopy during rainfall\n\\(\\overline{E}/\\overline{R}\\sum_{j=1}^n(P_{g,j}-{P'}_g)\\)\n\n\nEvaporation after rainfall ceases for \\(n\\) large storms\n\\(nS\\)\n\n\nEvaporation from trunks in \\(q\\) storms that fill the trunk storage\n\\(qS_t\\)\n\n\nEvaporation from trunks in \\(m+n-q\\) storms that do not fill the trunk storage\n\\(p_t\\sum_{j=1}^{m+n-q}P_{g,j}\\)\n\n\n\nIn applying the analytical model, saturated conditions are assumed to occur when the hourly rainfall exceeds a certain threshold. Often a threshold of 0.5 mm/hr is used. \\(\\overline{R}\\) is calculated for all hours when the rainfall exceeds the threshold to give an estimate of the mean rainfall rate onto a saturated canopy.\nGash (1979) has shown that in a regression of interception loss on rainfall (on a storm basis) the regression coefficient should equal to \\(\\overline{E}_w/\\overline{R}\\). Assuming that neither \\(\\overline{E}_w\\) nor \\(\\overline{R}\\) vary considerably in time, \\(\\overline{E}_w\\) can be estimated in this way from \\(\\overline{R}\\) in the absence of above-canopy climatic observations. Values derived in this way generally tend to be (much) higher than those calculated with the penman-monteith equation.\n\n\nThe modified rutter model\nFor sub daily timesteps the interception is calculated using a simplification of the Rutter model. The simplified model is solved explicitly and does not take drainage from the canopy into account.\nWflow.rainfall_interception_modrut\n\n\nInterception parameters from LAI\nThe SBM concept can determine the interception parameters from leaf area index (LAI) climatology. In order to switch this on you must define this cyclic parameter in the TOML file, the parameter is read from path_static, as follows:\n[input]\npath_forcing = \"data/forcing-moselle.nc\"\npath_static = \"data/staticmaps-moselle.nc\"\n\ncyclic = [\"vertical.leaf_area_index\"]\nFurthermore these additional parameters are required: + Specific leaf storage (sl \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\)) + Storage woody part of vegetation (swood \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\)) + Extinction coefficient (kext \\(\\SIb{}{-}\\))\nHere it is assumed that cmax \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\) (leaves) (canopy storage capacity for the leaves only) relates linearly with LAI (c.f. Van Dijk and Bruijnzeel 2001). This done via the sl. sl can be determined through a lookup table with land cover based on literature (Pitman 1989, Lui 1998). Next the cmax (leaves) is determined using:\n\\[\n    \\mathrm{cmax}(\\mathrm{leaves})  = \\mathrm{sl} \\cdot \\mathrm{LAI}\n\\]\nTo get to total storage (cmax) the woody part of the vegetation also needs to be added. As for sl, the storage of the woody part swood can also be related to land cover (lookup table).\nThe canopy gap fraction is determined using the extinction coefficient kext (van Dijk and Bruijnzeel 2001):\n\\[\n    \\mathrm{canopygapfraction} = \\exp(-\\subtext{k}{ext} \\cdot \\mathrm{LAI})\n\\]\nThe extinction coefficient kext can be related to land cover.",

These NC variables names refer to the example data of the wflow_sbm + kinematic wave model (see here).

They can be included in the same netCDF file, as long as their variable names are correctly mapped in the TOML settings file. See the section on example models on how to use this functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen using cyclic data, three different options are supported: - 12 (monthly) - 365 (daily, where Feb. 29 is not present, so the value for Feb. 28 is taken. Dec. 31 is represented by DOY 365) - 366 (where Feb. 29 represents DOY 60, and Dec. 31 DOY 366)\nIn contrast to the right-labelling of the forcing data (see below), the DOY/month of the current time step is used. For example: to simulate 2023-06-14 00:00:00 (with a daily time step), the DOY value at position 6 (when 12 values are provided), 165 (when 365 values are provided) or 166 (when 366 values are provided).",

    "text": "The forcing data (forcing.nc)\nThe forcing data typically contains the meteorological boundary conditions. This data is provided as a single netCDF file, with several variables containing the forcing data for precipitation, temperature and potential evaporation. The code snippet below shows the contents of the example file (downloaded here), and displaying the content with NCDatasets in Julia. As can be seen, each forcing variable (precip, pet and temp) consists of a three-dimensional dataset (x, y, and time), and each timestep consists of a two-dimensional map with values at each grid cell. Only values within the basin are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWflow expects the forcing to be “right-labelled”. This means that e.g. daily precipitation at 2023-06-15 00:00:00 is the accumulated total precipitation between 2023-06-14 00:00:00 and 2023-06-15 00:00:00.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor optimal computational performance, it is recommended to have chunks in the time dimension. This way, only part of the forcing file needs to be read and kept in memory. We recommend using a chunk size in the time dimension with size 1. Using larger chunks can largely degrade computational performance.\n\n\n\n\nClick to show example forcing.nc file\n\nGroup: /\n\nDimensions\n  time = 366\n  y = 313\n  x = 291\n\nVariables\n  time   (366)\n    Datatype:    Int64\n    Dimensions:  time\n    Attributes:\n    units                = days since 2000-01-02 00:00:00\n    calendar             = proleptic_gregorian\n\n  y   (313)\n    Datatype:    Float64\n    Dimensions:  y\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n\n  x   (291)\n    Datatype:    Float64\n    Dimensions:  x\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n\n  spatial_ref\n    Attributes:\n    crs_wkt              = GEOGCS[\"WGS 84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7030\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6326\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AXIS[\"Latitude\",NORTH],AXIS[\"Longitude\",EAST],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"]]\n    x_dim                = x\n    y_dim                = y\n    dim0                 = time\n\n  precip   (291 × 313 × 366)\n    Datatype:    Float32\n    Dimensions:  x × y × time\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n    unit                 = mm\n    precip_fn            = era5\n    coordinates          = idx_out spatial_ref mask\n\n  idx_out   (291 × 313)\n    Datatype:    Int32\n    Dimensions:  x × y\n\n  mask   (291 × 313)\n    Datatype:    UInt8\n    Dimensions:  x × y\n\n  pet   (291 × 313 × 366)\n    Datatype:    Float32\n    Dimensions:  x × y × time\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n    unit                 = mm\n    pet_fn               = era5\n    pet_method           = debruin\n    coordinates          = idx_out spatial_ref mask\n\n  temp   (291 × 313 × 366)\n    Datatype:    Float32\n    Dimensions:  x × y × time\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n    unit                 = degree C.\n    temp_fn              = era5\n    temp_correction      = True\n    coordinates          = idx_out spatial_ref mask\n\nGlobal attributes\n  unit                 = mm\n  precip_fn            = era5",
