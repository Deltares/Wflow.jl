# TODO: Create a struct to use instead of NamedTuple with fields lens, unit, description, default, type
# Which is then used to:
# - Generate the tables in the docs (filter entries based on the type field)
# - Not having to pass 'defaults' to ncread

# TODO: Add tests covering all lenses

# TODO: Construct docs tables from data here

# TODO: How to make sure model_struct.qmd doesn't get out of date?
