Compression increases computational time but can significantly reduce the size of the netCDF file. Set the compressionlevel variable to a value between 0 and 9. A setting of 0 means no compression, while values between 1 and 9 indicate increasing levels of compression (1: least compression, minimal run-time impact, 9: highest compression, maximum run-time impact).

For layered model parameters and variables that have an extra layer dimension and are part of the SBM soil model, an internal layer index can be specified (an example is provided below). If multiple layers are desired, this can be specified in separate [[output.netcdf_scalar.variable]] entries.

In the section Output CSV section, similar functionality is available for CSV. For integration with Delft-FEWS, it is recommended to write scalar data to netCDF format, as the General Adapter of Delft-FEWS can directly ingest data from netCDF files.

    "text": "How do I easily modify input parameters?\nSee this section on how to adjust maps, and this section on how to directly pass uniform values. Note that both options work for any parameter.\n\n\nHow do I start wflow with initial conditions from a previous run?\nSee here\n\n\nHow do I add external inflows and/or abstractions?\nriver_water__external_inflow_volume_flow_rate: positive for inflows, negative for abstraction. If parameter is time varying, add it to the correct section, see below. Note that these values can only be specified on river cells.\n\n\nHow do I add time-varying parameters?\nEither through cyclic (add parameter to cyclic list in the toml), or to the forcing section.\n\n\nHow do I add different output?\nSee here for csv output, here for scalar netcdf data, and here for gridded netcdf output.\n\n\nWhich river routing option should I choose?\nThe choice of a specific river routing option can vary depending on the model and use case. However, the numerical properties of the routing schemes provide an indication of their advantages and disadvantages.\nThe kinematic wave method is driven by the river slope within each cell, assuming that the water surface slope is parallel to the bed slope. This results in sharper discharge peaks with minimal damping, as the waves travel through the system without deformation. This approach is especially suitable for steep (upstream) areas where flow propagation is dominated by topography. The kinematic wave approach does not include any form of backwater effects.\nOn the other hand, the local inertial method incorporates the slope of the water surface into the momentum equation. This results in ‘damping effects’ on flow propagating through the cells and yields better results in scenarios where the water surface slope differs from the bed slope. This is particularly relevant in flat (downstream) regions where the river slope is limited or during the propagation of larger flood waves where the water surface slope is greater than the river slope itself. The local inertial method does incorporate backwater effects, although not as comprehensively as the full dynamic wave equation.\nGenerally, the kinematic wave method is computationally faster than the local inertial method for river (and land) routing. For the multi-threading execution of the kinematic wave, solved with a nonlinear scheme using Newton’s method, the order of execution (sub-basins) is important (from upstream to downstream sub-basin). For the momentum equation of the local inertial approach an explicit numerical method is used and can be solved independently for each cell during multi-threading execution. As a consequence, speedups for local inertial routing are larger than for kinematic wave routing using multi-threading (compared to a single thread run) and the difference between local inertial and kinematic wave routing run times gets smaller as the number of threads increase.\nCurrently, only the local inertial approach supports the inclusion of floodplains in river routing, see also this question.\n\n\nWhich land routing option should I choose?\nSimilar to river routing, the selection of the type of land routing depends on the model and use case. In practice, the kinematic wave approach is often sufficient for land routing. When the kinematic wave approach is used, water can flow from land cells into river cells, but not the other way around. The local inertial method for land routing is considered in cases where routing occurs over very flat areas or where complicated inundation patterns need to be included in both land and river routing.\nThe computational differences between the two options are larger than those between river routing options. This is due to the fact that there are typically more land cells than river cells in a model, and that for local inertial land routing two momentum equations (in the x and y direction) need to be solved. Consequently, more equations (with a higher computational cost compared to the kinematic wave method) must be solved compared to the combination of kinematic wave for land routing and local inertial for river routing.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between 1D, 2D and no floodplains?\nEffects of floodplain flow can be included in several ways. A one-dimensional sub-grid approximation (hence the name 1D floodplains) can be included when kinematic wave land routing is combined with local inertial river routing. The water surface elevations of the river channel and the floodplain are the same and it is assumed that water is exchanged instantaneously between the river channel and the floodplain. When the water depth in the river channel rises above the river bankfull depth, water is exchanged between the river channel and the floodplain resulting in an attenuation of the discharge peaks.\n\n\n\nSchematization of the 1D floodplain concept (side view)\n\n\nRouting is done separately for the river channel and floodplain, and using this feature does result in larger computational times.\nAlso for the local inertial approximation of both land and river routing, the water surface elevations of the river channel and the associated land cell (floodplain) are the same and is it assumed that water is exchanged instantaneously between the river channel and associated land cell (floodplain). Between land cells water can flow in two directions (x and y direction) hence the term 2D floodplain method. Additionally, saturation‐excess and infiltration‐excess overland flow are routed in two directions. Note that overland flow can not occur diagonally as opposed to the river routing, which may overestimate flow paths near river cells. Furthermore, as water from the river is exchanged with the full land cell the inundation area can be overestimated, especially for small river channels or land cells with relatively large sub-grid elevational differences. If these limitations are not acceptable, the 1D floodplain method can be used instead.\n\n\n\nSchematization of the 2D floodplain concept (top view)\n\n\nIt is also possible to run the model without 1D or 2D floodplains. This means that the model is using kinematic wave for land routing and either kinematic wave or local inertial for river routing. This can lead to unrealistically large water depths when the bankfull capacity is exceeded as there is no exchange of water between the river channel and (1D or 2D) floodplains.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Inland Sediment Model\n\nSediment Flux in overland flow\nOnce the amount of soil detached by both rainfall and overland flow has been estimated, it has then to be routed and delivered to the river network. Inland routing in sediment models is usually done by comparing the amount of detached sediment with the transport capacity of the flow, which is the maximum amount of sediment that the flow can carry downslope. There are several existing formulas available in the literature. For a wide range of slopes and for overland flow, the Govers equation (1990) seems the most appropriate choice (Hessel et al, 2007). However, as the wflow_sediment model was developed to be linked to water quality issues, the Yalin transport equation was chosen as it can handle particle differentiation (Govers equation can still be used if wflow_sediment is used to only model inland processes with no particle differentiation). For land cells, wflow_sediment assumes that erosion can mobilize 5 classes of sediment:\n\nClay (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{2}{\\mu m}\\))\nSilt (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{10}{\\mu m}\\))\nSand (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{200}{\\mu m}\\))\nSmall aggregates (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{30}{\\mu m}\\))\nLarge aggregates (mean diameter of \\(\\SI{50}{\\mu m}\\)).\n\n\\[\\begin{gathered}\n   \\mathrm{PSA} = \\mathrm{SAN} (1-\\mathrm{CLA})^{2.4} \\\\\n   \\mathrm{PSI} = 0.13\\mathrm{SIL}\\\\\n   \\mathrm{PCL} = 0.20\\mathrm{CLA} \\\\\n\n   \\mathrm{SAG} =\n   \\begin{align*}\n      \\begin{cases}\n         2.0\\mathrm{CLA} &\\text{ if }\\quad \\mathrm{CLA} &lt; 0.25 \\\\\n         0.28(\\mathrm{CLA}-0.25)+0.5 &\\text{ if }\\quad 0.25 \\leq \\mathrm{CLA} \\leq 0.5 \\\\\n         0.57 &\\text{ if }\\quad \\mathrm{CLA} &gt; 0.5\n      \\end{cases}\n   \\end{align*} \\\\\n\n   \\mathrm{LAG} = 1 - \\mathrm{PSA} - \\mathrm{PSI} - \\mathrm{PCL} - \\mathrm{SAG}\n\\end{gathered}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathrm{CLA}\\), \\(\\mathrm{SIL}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{SAN}\\) are the primary clay, silt, sand fractions of the topsoil and \\(\\mathrm{PCL}\\), \\(\\mathrm{PSI}\\), \\(\\mathrm{PSA}\\), \\(\\mathrm{SAG}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{LAG}\\) are the clay, silt, sand, small and large aggregates fractions of the detached sediment respectively.

    "section": "River Sediment Model",
    "text": "River Sediment Model\nSediment dynamics in rivers can be described by the same three processes on land: erosion, deposition and transport. The difference is that channel ﬂow is much higher, deeper and permanent compared to overland ﬂow. In channels, erosion is the direct removal of sediments from the river bed or bank (lateral erosion). Sediments are transported in the river either by rolling, sliding and silting (bed load transport) or via turbulent flow in the higher water column (suspended load transport). The type of transport is determined by the river bed shear stress. As sediment particles have a higher density than water, they can also be deposited on the river bed according to their settling velocity compared to the ﬂow velocity. In addition to regular deposition in the river, lakes, reservoirs and floodplains represents additional major sediment settling pools.\nComplete models of sediment dynamics based on hydrology and not on hydraulics or hydrodynamics are much rarer than for soil loss and inland dynamics. The simpler models such as the SWAT default sediment river model uses again the transport capacity of the ﬂow to determine if there is erosion or deposition (Neitsch et al., 2011). A more physics-based approach (Partheniades, 1965) to determine river erosion is used by Liu et al. (2018) and in the new SWAT’s approach developed by Narasimhan et al. (2017). For wﬂow_sediment, the new physics-based model of SWAT was chosen for transport and erosion as it enables the use of parameter estimation for erosion of bed and bank of the channel and separates the suspended from the bed loads.\n\n\n\nOverview of the different processes for a river cell in wflow_sediment.\n\n\nRunning the river model is an option of the wflow_sediment model and is enabled using the TOML file. By default it is false:\n[model]\nrun_river_model__flag = true\n\nSediment inputs in a river cell\nThe first part of the river model assesses how much detached sediment are in the river cell at the beginning of the timestep \\(t\\). Sources of detached sediment are sediments coming from land erosion, estimated with the soil loss part of wflow_sediment model, the sediment coming from upstream river cells and the detached sediment that were left in the cell at the end of the previous timestep \\((t-1)\\):\n\\[\n   (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in})_t = (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{land})_t + \\mathrm{upstream}\\left[(\\subtext{\\text{sed}}{out})_{t-1}\\right] + (\\subtext{\\text{sed}}{riv})_{t-1}\n\\]\n\n\nRiver transport and erosion\nOnce the amount of sediment inputs at the beginning of the timestep is known, the model then estimates transport, and river erosion if there is a deficit of sediments. Transport in the river system is estimated via a transport capacity formula. There are several transport capacity formulas available in wflow_sediment, some requiring calibration and some not. Choosing a transport capacity equation depends on the river characteristics (some equation are more suited for narrow or wider rivers), and on the reliability of the required river parameters (such as slope, width or mean particle diameter of the river channel). Several river transport capacity are available and the choice is set up in the model section of the TOML:\n[model]\nriver_transport = \"bagnold\" # River flow transport capacity method: [\"bagnold\", \"engelund\", \"yang\", \"kodatie\", \"molinas\"]\nSimplified Bagnold\nOriginally more valid for intermediate to large rivers, this simplified version of the Bagnold equation relates sediment transport to flow velocity with two simple calibration parameters (Neitsch et al, 2011):\n\\[\nC_{\\max} = \\subtext{c}{sp}  \\left( \\dfrac{\\mathrm{prf} Q}{h W} \\right)^{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{C_{\\max}}{kg\\ L^{-1}}\\) (or \\(\\SIb{}{ton\\ m^{-1}}\\)) is the sediment concentration, \\(\\SIb{Q}{m^3\\ s^{-1}}\\) is the surface runoff in the river cell, \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) is the river water level, \\(\\SIb{W}{m}\\) is the river width and \\(\\subtext{c}{sp}\\), \\(\\mathrm{prf}\\) and \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}\\) are calibration parameters. The \\(\\mathrm{prf}\\) coefficient is usually used to deduce the peak velocity of the flow, but for simplification in wflow_sediment, the equation was simplified to only get two parameters to calibrate: \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}\\) and \\(\\subtext{c}{Bagnold} = \\subtext{c}{sp} \\,\n\\mathrm{prf}^{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}}\\). The coefficient \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sp}}{exp}\\) usually varies between \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) while \\(\\mathrm{prf}\\) and \\(\\subtext{c}{sp}\\) have a wider range of variation.

The resulting equation, for a rectangular channel, is (Neitsch et al, 2011): \\[\n   C_{\\max} = \\left( \\dfrac{a u^{b} h^{c} S^{d}}{\\subtext{V}{in}} \\right)  W\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{V}{in}}{m^3}\\) in the volume of water entering the river cell during the timestep and \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are coefficients depending on the riverbed sediment size.

The sand equation (\\(D_{50} &lt; \\SI{2.0}{mm}\\)) is:\n\\[\n   \\log\\left(C_{ppm}\\right) = 5.435 - 0.286\\log\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\\nu}\\right)-0.457\\log\\left(\\frac{u_*}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right) \\\\\n   +\\left(1.799-0.409\\log\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\\nu}\\right)-0.314\\log\\left(\\frac{u_*}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right)\\right)\\log\\left(\\frac{uS}{\\omega_{s,50}}-\\frac{u_{cr}S}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right)\n\\]\nAnd the gravel equation (\\(\\SI{2.0}{mm} \\leq D_{50} &lt; \\SI{10.0}{mm}\\)) is:\n\\[\n   \\log\\left(C_{ppm}\\right) = 6.681 - 0.633\\log\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\\nu}\\right)-4.816\\log\\left(\\frac{u_*}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right) \\\\\n   +\\left(2.784-0.305\\log\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\\nu}\\right)-0.282\\log\\left(\\frac{u_*}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right)\\right)\\log\\left(\\frac{uS}{\\omega_{s,50}}-\\frac{u_{cr}S}{\\omega_{s,50}}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_{ppm}\\) is sediment concentration in parts per million by weight, \\(\\SIb{\\omega_{s,50}}{m\\ s^{-1}}\\) is the settling velocity of a particle with the median riverbed diameter estimated with Stokes, \\(\\SIb{\\nu}{m^2\\ s^{-1}}\\) is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, \\(\\SIb{u_*}{m\\ s^{-1}}\\) is the shear velocity where \\(u_* = \\sqrt{gR_{H}S}\\) with \\(R_{H}\\) the hydraulic radius of the river and \\(\\SIb{u_{cr}}{m\\ s^{-1}}\\) is the critical velocity (equation can be found in Hessel, 2007).\nMolinas and Wu The Molinas and Wu (2001) transport equation was developed for large sand-bed rivers based on the universal stream power \\(\\psi\\). The corresponding equation is (Neitsch et al, 2011):\n\\[\n   C_{w} = \\dfrac{1430 (0.86+\\sqrt{\\psi}) \\psi^{1.5}}{0.016+\\psi} 10^{-6}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\psi\\) is the universal stream power given by:\n\\[\n   \\psi = \\dfrac{\\psi^{3}}{\\left(\\dfrac{\\rho_{s}}{\\rho}-1\\right) g h \\omega_{s,50}  \\left[ \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{h}{D_{50}}\\right)\\right]^{2}}\n\\]\nOnce the maximum concentration \\(C_{\\max}\\) is established with one of the above transport formula, the model then determines if there is erosion of the river bed and bank. In order to do that, the difference \\(sed_{ex}\\) between the maximum amount of sediment estimated with transport (\\(\\mathrm{sed}_{\\max} = C_{\\max} \\subtext{V}{in}\\)) and the sediment inputs to the river cell (\\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in}\\) calculated above) is calculated. If too much sediment is coming in and \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{ex}\\) is negative, then there is no river bed and bank erosion. And if the river has not reach its maximum transport capacity, then erosion of the river happens.\nFirst, the sediments stored in the cell from deposition in previous timesteps \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{stor}\\) are eroded from clay to gravel. If this amount is not enough to cover \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{ex}\\), then erosion of the local river bed and bank material starts.\nInstead of just setting river erosion amount to just cover the remaining difference \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{exeff}\\) between \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{ex}\\) and \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{stor}\\), actual erosion potential is adjusted using river characteristics and is separated between the bed and bank of the river using the physics-based approach of Knight (1984).\nThe bed and bank of the river are supposed to only be able to erode a maximum amount of their material \\(E_{R,\\mathrm{bed}}\\) for the bed and \\(E_{R,\\mathrm{bank}}\\) for the river bank. For a rectangular channel, assuming it is meandering and thus only one bank is prone to erosion, they are calculated from the equations (Neitsch et al, 2011):\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n   E_{R,\\mathrm{bed}} = k_{d,\\mathrm{bed}} \\left( \\tau_{e,\\mathrm{bed}} - \\tau_{cr,\\mathrm{bed}} \\right) 10^{-6}  L  W  \\rho_{b, \\mathrm{bed}}  \\Delta t \\\\\n   E_{R,\\mathrm{bank}} = k_{d,\\mathrm{bank}} \\left( \\tau_{e,\\mathrm{bank}} - \\tau_{cr,\\mathrm{bank}} \\right) 10^{-6} L h \\rho_{b, \\mathrm{bank}}  \\Delta t\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{E_R}{ton}\\) is the potential bed/bank erosion rates, \\(\\SIb{k_d}{cm^3\\ N^{-1}\\\ns^{-1}}\\) is the erodibility of the bed/bank material, \\(\\SIb{\\tau_e}{N\\ m^{-2}}\\) is the effective shear stress from the flow on the bed/bank, \\(\\SIb{\\tau_{cr}}{N\\ m^{-2}}\\) is the critical shear stress for erosion to happen, \\(\\SIb{L}{m}\\), \\(\\SIb{W}{m}\\) and \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) are the channel length, width and water height, \\(\\SIb{\\rho_{b}}{g\\ cm^{-3}}\\) is the bulk density of the bed/bank of the river and \\(\\SIb{\\Delta t}{s}\\) is the model timestep.\nIn wflow_sediment, the erodibility of the bed/bank are approximated using the formula from Hanson and Simon (2001):\n\\[\n   k_d=0.2 \\tau_{cr}^{-0.5}\n\\]\nNormally erodibilities are evaluated using jet test in the field and there are several reviews and some adjustments possible to this equation (Simon et al, 2011). However, to avoid too heavy calibration and for the scale considered, this equation is supposed to be efficient enough. The critical shear stress \\(\\tau_{cr}\\) is evaluated differently for the bed and bank. For the bed, the most common formula from Shields initiation of movement is used. For the bank, a more recent approach from Julian and Torres (2006) is used:\n\\[\n   \\tau_{cr,\\mathrm{bank}} = (0.1+0.1779 SC+0.0028 SC^{2}-2.34 10^{-5}  SC^{3}) C_{ch}\n\\]\nwhere \\(SC\\) is the percent clay and silt content of the river bank and \\(C_{ch}\\) is a coefficient taking into account the positive impact of vegetation on erosion reduction. This coefficient is then dependent on the land use and classical values are shown in the table below. These values where then adapted for use with the GlobCover land use map. Percent of clay and silt (along with sand and gravel) for the channel is estimated from the river median particle diameter assuming the same values as SWAT shown in the table below. Median particle diameter is here estimated depending on the Strahler river order. The higher the order, the smaller the diameter is. As the median diameter is only used in wflow_sediment for the estimation of the river bed/bank sediment composition, this supposition should be enough. Actual refined data or calibration may however be needed if the median diameter is also required for the transport formula. In a similar way, the bulk densities of river bed and bank are also just assumed to be of respectively \\(\\SI{1.5}{g\\ cm^{-3}}\\) and \\(\\SI{1.4}{g\\\ncm^{-3}}\\).\n\nClassical values of the channel cover vegetation coefficient (Julian and Torres, 2006)\n\n\nBank vegetation\n\\(C_{ch}\\)\n\n\n\n\nNone\n1.00\n\n\nGrassy\n1.97\n\n\nSparse trees\n5.40\n\n\nDense trees\n19.20\n\n\n\n\nComposition of the river bed/bank depending on the median diameter \\(\\SIb{d_{50}}{\\mu m}\\) (Neitsch et al, 2011)\n\n\nSediment Fraction\n\\(\\leq\\) 5\n5 to 50\n50 to 2000\n\\(&gt;\\) 2000\n\n\n\n\nSand\n0.15\n0.15\n0.65\n0.15\n\n\nSilt\n0.15\n0.65\n0.15\n0.15\n\n\nClay\n0.65\n0.15\n0.15\n0.05\n\n\nGravel\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n0.65\n\n\n\nThen, the repartition of the flow shear stress is refined into the effective shear stress and the bed and bank of the river using the equations developed by Knight (1984) for a rectangular channel:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n   \\tau_{e,\\mathrm{bed}} = \\rho g R_{H} S  \\left(1 - \\dfrac{SF_{\\mathrm{bank}}}{100}\\right) \\left(1+\\dfrac{2h}{W}\\right) \\\\\n   \\tau_{e,\\mathrm{bank}} = \\rho g R_{H} S  \\left( SF_{\\mathrm{bank}}\\right)  \\left(1+\\dfrac{W}{2h}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho g\\) is the fluid specific weight (\\(\\SI{9800}{N\\ m^{-3}}\\) for water), \\(\\SIb{R_H}{m}\\) is the hydraulic radius of the channel, \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) and \\(\\SIb{W}{m}\\) are the water level and river width. \\(SF_{\\mathrm{bank}}\\) is the proportion of shear stress acting on the bank (%) and is estimated from (Knight, 1984):\n\\[\n   \\mathrm{SF}_{\\mathrm{bank}} = \\exp \\left( -3.230 \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{W}{h}+3\\right)+6.146 \\right)\n\\]\nFinally the relative erosion potential of the bank and bed of the river is calculated by:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n   \\mathrm{RTE}_{\\mathrm{bed}} = \\dfrac{E_{R,\\mathrm{bed}}}{E_{R,\\mathrm{bed}}+E_{R,\\mathrm{bank}}} \\\\\n   \\mathrm{RTE}_{\\mathrm{bank}} = 1 - RTE_{\\mathrm{bed}}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nAnd the final actual eroded amount for the bed and bank is the maximum between \\(\\mathrm{RTE}\n\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{exeff}\\) and the erosion potential \\(E_R\\). Total eroded amount of sediment \\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod}\\) is then the sum of the eroded sediment coming from the storage of previously deposited sediment and the river bed/bank erosion.\n\n\nRiver deposition\nAs sediments have a higher density than water, moving sediments in water can be deposited in the river bed. The deposition process depends on the mass of the sediment, but also on flow characteristics such as velocity. In wflow_sediment, as in SWAT, deposition is modelled with Einstein’s equation (Neitsch et al, 2011):\n\\[\n   \\subtext{P}{dep}=\\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{e^{x}}\\right)100\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\subtext{P}{dep}\\) is the percentage of sediments that is deposited on the river bed and x is a parameter calculated with:\n\\[\n   x = \\dfrac{1.055 L  \\omega_{s}}{u h}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{L}{m}\\) and \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) are channel length and water height, \\(\\SIb{\\omega_s}{m\\\ns^{-1}}\\) is the particle settling velocity calculated with Stokes’ formula and \\(\\SIb{u}{m\\\ns^{-1}}\\) is the mean flow velocity. The calculated percentage is then subtracted from the amount of sediment input and eroded river sediment for each particle size class (\\(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{dep} = \\subtext{P}{dep}/100 (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in} +\n\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod})\\)). Resulting deposited sediment are then stored in the river bed and can be re-mobilized in future time steps by erosion.\n\n\nMass balance and sediment concentration\nFinally after estimating inputs, deposition and erosion with the transport capacity of the flow, the amount of sediment actually leaving the river cell to go downstream is estimated using:\n\\[\n   \\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{out} = (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in} + \\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod} - \\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{dep}) \\dfrac{\\subtext{V}{out}}{V}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{out}}{ton}\\) is the amount of sediment leaving the river cell (tons), \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{in}}{ton}\\) is the amount of sediment coming into the river cell (storage from previous timestep, land erosion and sediment flux from upstream river cells), \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod}}{ton}\\) is the amount of sediment coming from river erosion, \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{dep}}{ton}\\) is the amount of deposited sediments, \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{V}{out}}{m^3}\\) is the volume of water leaving the river cell (surface runoff \\(Q\\) times timestep \\(\\Delta t\\)) and \\(\\SIb{V}{m^3}\\) is the total volume of water in the river cell (\\(\\subtext{V}{out}\\) plus storage \\(h W L\\)).\nA mass balance is then used to calculate the amount of sediment remaining in the cell at the end of the timestep \\((\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{riv})_t\\):\n\\[\n   (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{riv})_t = (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{riv})_{t-1} + (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{land})_t + \\mathrm{upstream}\\left[(\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{out})_{t-1}\\right] + (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{erod})_t - (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{dep})_t - (\\subtext{\\mathrm{sed}}{out})_t\n\\]\n\n\nReservoir modelling\nApart from land and river, the hydrological wflow_sbm model also handles reservoir modelling. In wflow_sbm, reservoir nodes representing reservoirs, (natural) lakes or other water storage features are modelled using a 1D bucket model at the cell corresponding to the outlet. For the other cells belonging to the reservoir which are not the outlet, processes such as precipitation and evaporation are filtered out and shifted to the outlet cell. wflow_sediment handles the reservoirs in the same way. If a cell belongs to a reservoir and is not the outlet then the model assumes that no erosion/deposition of sediments is happening and the sediments are transported to the reservoir outlet. Once the sediments reach the outlet, then sediments are deposited in the reservoir according to Camp’s model (1945) (Verstraeten et al, 2000):\n\\[\n   \\mathrm{TE} = \\dfrac{\\omega_s}{u_{cr,\\mathrm{res}}} = \\dfrac{\\subtext{A}{res}}{\\subtext{Q}{out,res}} \\omega_s\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathrm{TE}\\) is the trapping efficiency of the reservoir (or the fraction of particles trapped), \\(\\SIb{\\omega_{s}}{m\\ s^{-1}}\\) is the particle velocity from Stokes, \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{u}{cr,res}}{m\\ s^{-1}}\\) is the reservoir’s critical settling velocity which is equal to the reservoir’s outflow \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{Q}{out,res}}{m^3\\ s^{-1}}\\) divided by the reservoir’s surface area \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{A}{res}}{m^2}\\).\nFor reservoirs, coarse sediment particles from the bed load are also assumed to be trapped by the dam structure. This adding trapping is taken into account with a reservoir trapping efficiency coefficient for large particles (between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\)). Depending on the type of the dam, all bed load particles are trapped (reservoir_water_sediment__bedload_trapping_efficiency = 1.0, for example for a gravity dam) or only partly (for example for run-of-the-river dams).\nReservoir modelling is enabled in the model section of the TOML and require the extra following input arguments:\n[model]\nreservoir__flag = true\n\n[input]\nreservoir_area__count = \"wflow_reservoirareas\"\nreservoir_location__count = \"wflow_reservoirlocs\"\n\n[input.static]\nreservoir_surface__area = \"ResSimpleArea\"\nreservoir_water_sediment__bedload_trapping_efficiency = \"ResTrapEff\"\nNote that in the inland part, reservoir coverage is used to filter erosion and transport in overland flow.",

For the subgrid channel, Neal et al. (2012) make use of a D4 (four direction) scheme, while here a D8 (eight direction) scheme is used, in combination with the D4 scheme for 2D overland flow.\nIn the TOML file the following properties related to the local inertial model with 1D river routing and 2D overland flow can be provided for the sbm and sbm_gwf model types:\n[model]\nland_routing = \"local_inertial\"                     # default is kinematic_wave\nriver_routing = \"local_inertial\"                    # default is kinematic_wave\nland_local_inertial_flow__alpha_coefficient = 0.5   # alpha coefficient for model stability (default = 0.7)\nland_local_inertial_flow__theta_coefficient = 0.9   # weighting factor that adjusts the amount of artificial numerical diffusion (default = 1.0)\nland_surface_water_flow__froude_limit_flag = true   # default is true, limit flow to subcritical-critical according to Froude number\nland_surface_water_flow_threshold__depth = 0.1      # water depth [m] threshold for calculating flow between cells (default = 1e-03)\nThe alpha coefficient, flow limitation according to the Froude number, and the adaptive model time step \\(\\Delta t\\) are explained in more detail in the River and floodplain routing section of the local inertial model.",

    "section": "Aquifer types",
    "text": "Aquifer types\nGroundwater flow can occur either in a confined or unconfined aquifer. Confined aquifers are overlain by a poorly permeable confining layer (e.g. clay). No air can get in to fill the pore space so that the aquifer always remains fully saturated. For a confined aquifer, water will always flow along the complete height \\(\\SIb{H}{m}\\) over the aquifer and transmissivity \\(\\SIb{kH}{m^2\\ d^{-1}}\\) is a constant (\\(\\SIb{k}{m\\ d^{-1}}\\) is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity). Specific storage is the amount of water an aquifer releases per unit change in hydraulic head, per unit volume of aquifer, as the aquifer and the groundwater itself is compressed. Its value is much smaller than specific yield, between \\(10^{-5}\\) (stiff) and \\(10^{-2}\\) (weak).\nThe upper boundary of an unconfined aquifer is the water table (the phreatic surface). Specific yield (or drainable porosity) represents the volumetric fraction the aquifer will yield when all water drains and the pore volume is filled by air instead. Specific yield will vary roughly between \\(0.05\\) (clay) and \\(0.45\\) (peat) (Johnson, 1967).\nGroundwater flow is solved forward in time and central in space. The vertically averaged governing equation for an inhomogeneous and isotropic aquifer in one dimension can be written as:\n\\[\n    S \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} =  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(kH \\frac{\\phi}{\\delta x}\\right) + Q\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{S}{m\\ m^{-1}}\\) is storativity (or specific yield), \\(\\SIb{\\phi}{m}\\) is hydraulic head, \\(t\\) is time, \\(\\SIb{k}{m\\ t^{-1}}\\) is horizontal hydraulic conductivity, \\(\\SIb{H}{m}\\) is the (saturated) aquifer height: groundwater level - aquifer bottom elevation and \\(\\SIb{Q}{m\\ t^{-1}}\\) represents fluxes from boundary conditions (e.g. recharge or abstraction), see also Aquifer boundary conditions.\nThe simplest finite difference formulation is forward in time, central in space, and can be written as:\n\\[\n    S_i  \\frac{\\phi_{i}^{t+1} - \\phi_i^{t}}{\\Delta t} = -C_{i-1}  (\\phi_{i-1} - \\phi_i) - C_i  (\\phi_{i+1} - \\phi_i) + Q_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(i\\) is the cell index, \\(t\\) is time, \\(\\Delta t\\) is the step size, \\(C_{i-1}\\) is the the intercell conductance between cell \\(i-1\\) and \\(i\\) and \\(C_i\\) is the intercell conductance between cell \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\).\nConductance \\(C\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nC = \\frac{kH w}{l}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{w}{m}\\) is the width of the cell to cell connection, and \\(\\SIb{l}{m}\\) is the length of the cell to cell connection. \\(k\\) and \\(H\\) may both vary in space; intercell conductance is therefore an average using the properties of two cells. For the calculation of the intercell conductance \\(C\\) the harmonic mean is used (see also Goode and Appel, 1992), here between cell index \\(i\\) and cell index \\(i+1\\), in the \\(x\\) direction:\n\\[\n    C_i = w  \\frac{k_iH_i\\cdot k_{i+1}H_{i+1}}{k_iH_i \\cdot l_{i+1} + k_{i+1}H_{i+1} \\cdot l_i}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{H}{m}\\) is the aquifer top - aquifer bottom, and \\(k\\), \\(l_i\\) is the length in cell \\(i\\) (\\(0.5 \\Delta x_i\\)), \\(l_{i+1}\\) is the length in cell \\(i+1\\) (\\(0.5 \\Delta x_{i+1}\\)) and \\(w\\) as previously defined. For an unconfined aquifer the intercell conductance is scaled by using the “upstream saturated fraction” as the MODFLOW documentation calls it. In this approach, the saturated thickness of a cell-to-cell is approximated using the cell with the highest head. This results in a consistent overestimation of the saturated thickness, but it avoids complexities related with cell drying and rewetting, such as having to define a “wetting threshold” or a “wetting factor”. See also the documentation for MODFLOW-NWT (Niswonger et al., 2011) or MODFLOW6 (Langevin et al., 2017) for more background information. For more background on drying and rewetting, see for example McDonald et al. (1991).\nFor the finite difference formulation, there is only one unknown, \\(\\phi_i^{t+1}\\). Reshuffling terms:\n\\[\n\\phi_i^{t+1} = \\phi_i^t + (C_{i-1}  (\\phi_i - \\phi_{i-1}) + C_i  (\\phi_{i+1} - \\phi_i) + Q_i) \\frac{Δt}{S_i}\n\\]\nThis can be generalized to two dimensions, for both regular and irregular cell connectivity. Finally, a stable time step size can be computed given the forward-in-time, central in space scheme, based on the following criterion from Chu and Willis (1984):\n\\[\n  \\frac{\\Delta t k H}{\\Delta x  \\Delta y S}  \\le \\alpha\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{\\Delta t}{d}\\) is the stable time step size, \\(\\SIb{\\Delta x}{m}\\) is the cell length in the \\(x\\) direction and \\(\\SIb{\\Delta y}{m}\\) is the cell length in the \\(y\\) direction, \\(\\SIb{k}{m^2\\ d^{-1}}\\) is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity, \\(\\SIb{H}{m}\\) is the saturated thickness of the aquifer and \\(\\alpha\\) is a coefficient to enhance the stability of the simulation. For each cell \\(\\frac{\\Delta x  \\Delta y S}{k H}\\) is calculated, the minimum of these values is determined, and multiplied by \\(\\alpha\\), to get the stable time step size. The stability coefficient \\(\\alpha\\) (default = 0.25 as recommended by Chu and Willis (1984)) can be set as follows in the TOML file:\n[model]\nsubsurface_water_flow__alpha_coefficient = 0.2 # coefficient for model stability (default = 0.25)\nFor more details about the finite difference formulation and the stable time step size criterion we refer to the paper of Chu and Willis (1984).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUsing the default value for the stability criterion from Chu and Willis (1984) can cause in some cases numerical instabilities, for example source and sink flux terms are not included. We recommend to check for possible numerical instabilities, especially when fluxes from aquifer boundaries (e.g. river) can be large.\n\n\nBoundary conditions can be classified into three categories:\n\nspecified head (Dirichlet)\nspecified flux (Neumann)\nhead-dependent flux (Robin)\n\nNeumann and Robin conditions are implemented by adding to or subtracting from a net (lumped) cell flux. Dirichlet conditions are special cased, since they cannot (easily) be implemented via the flux, but the head is set directly instead.\nThe groundwater flow component of model type sbm_gwf consists of a single layer unconfined aquifer. The list of input parameters for an unconfined aquifer can be found here. Hydraulic head \\(\\SIb{\\phi}{m}\\) is an output and state variable.\nBelow an example of setting the conductivity_profile and input parameters in the TOML configuration file for an unconfined aquifer:\n[model]\nconductivity_profile = \"exponential\"  # saturated hydraulic conductivity depth profile, default is \"uniform\"\n\n[input.static]\nland_surface__elevation = \"wflow_dem\"\nsubsurface_surface_water__horizontal_saturated_hydraulic_conductivity = \"kh_surface\"\nsubsurface_water__specific_yield = \"specific_yield\"\nsubsurface__horizontal_saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_scale_parameter = \"gwf_f\"",

    "text": "Rainfall interception\nTwo different interception models are available: the Gash model, and the modified Rutter model. The simulation timestep defines which interception model is used, where daily (or larger) timesteps use the Gash model, and timesteps smaller than daily use the modified Rutter model.\n\nThe Gash model\nThe Gash interception model (Gash, 1979) can to be applied on a daily basis, although a storm-based approach will yield better results in situations with more than one storm per day. The amount of water needed to completely saturate the canopy is defined as:\n\\[\n    P'=\\frac{-\\overline{R}S}{\\overline{E}_{w}}\\log\\left[1-\\frac{\\overline{E}_{w}}{\\overline{R}}(1-p-p_{t})^{-1}\\right],\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\overline{R}\\) is the average precipitation intensity on a saturated canopy and \\(\\overline{E}_{w}\\) the average evaporation from the wet canopy and with the vegetation parameters \\(S\\), \\(p\\) and \\(p_t\\) as defined previously. The model uses a series of expressions to calculate the interception loss during different phases of a storm. An analytical integration of the total evaporation and rainfall under saturated canopy conditions is performed for each storm to determine average values of \\(\\overline{E}_{w}\\) and \\(\\overline{R}\\). The total evaporation from the canopy (the total interception loss) is calculated as the sum of the components listed in the table below. Interception losses from the stems are calculated for days with \\(P\\geq S_{t}/p_{t}\\). \\(p_t\\) and \\(S_t\\) are small and neglected.\n\nFormulation of the components of interception loss according to Gash:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\nInterception loss\n\n\n\n\nFor \\(m\\) small storms (\\(P_{g}&lt;{P'}_{g}\\))\n\\((1-p-p_{t})\\sum_{j=1}^{m}P_{g,j}\\)\n\n\nWetting up the canopy in \\(n\\) large storms (\\(P_{g}\\geq{P'}_{g}\\))\n\\(n(1-p-p_{t}){P'}_{g}-nS\\)\n\n\nEvaporation from saturated canopy during rainfall\n\\(\\overline{E}/\\overline{R}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(P_{g,j}-{P'}_{g})\\)\n\n\nEvaporation after rainfall ceases for \\(n\\) large storms\n\\(nS\\)\n\n\nEvaporation from trunks in \\(q\\) storms that fill the trunk storage\n\\(qS_{t}\\)\n\n\nEvaporation from trunks in \\(m+n-q\\) storms that do not fill the trunk storage\n\\(p_{t}\\sum_{j=1}^{m+n-q}P_{g,j}\\)\n\n\n\nSaturated conditions are assumed to occur when the hourly rainfall exceeds a certain threshold. Often a threshold of \\(\\SI{0.5}{mm\\ h^{-1}}\\) is used. \\(\\overline{R}\\) is calculated for all hours when the rainfall exceeds the threshold to give an estimate of the mean rainfall rate onto a saturated canopy.\nGash (1979) has shown that in a regression of interception loss on rainfall (on a storm basis) the regression coefficient should equal to \\(\\overline{E}_w/\\overline{R}\\). Assuming that neither \\(\\overline{E}_w\\) nor \\(\\overline{R}\\) vary considerably in time, \\(\\overline{E}_w\\) can be estimated in this way from \\(\\overline{R}\\) in the absence of above-canopy climatic observations. Values derived in this way generally tend to be (much) higher than those calculated with the penman-monteith equation.\n\n\nThe modified rutter model\nFor sub daily timesteps the interception is calculated using a simplification of the Rutter model. The simplified model is solved explicitly and does not take drainage from the canopy into account. The stemflow fraction is defined as a fixed fraction (0.1) of canopy gap fraction \\(\\SIb{f_\\mathrm{canopygap}}{-}\\) limited by the canopy fraction \\((1-f_\\mathrm{canopygap})\\) and the amount of stemflow is taken as the stemflow fraction of precipitation. Throughfall equals to the amount of water that cannot be stored by the canopy, plus the rainfall that is not captured by the canopy. Water can evaporate from the canopy storage, taken as the minimum between potential evaporation and the current storage. The “left-over” potential evaporation (if any) is returned as output.\n\n\nInterception parameters from LAI\nThe SBM concept can determine the interception parameters from leaf area index (\\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{LAI}}{m^2 m^{-2}}\\)) climatology. In order to switch this on you must define this cyclic parameter in the TOML file, the parameter is read from path_static, as follows:\n[input]\npath_forcing = \"forcing-moselle.nc\"\npath_static = \"staticmaps-moselle.nc\"\n\n[input.cyclic]\nvegetation__leaf_area_index = \"LAI\"\nFurthermore, these additional parameters are required:\n\nSpecific leaf storage (\\(\\SIb{S_\\mathrm{leaf}}{mm}\\))\nStorage woody part of vegetation (\\(\\SIb{S_\\mathrm{wood, max}}{mm}\\))\nExtinction coefficient (\\(\\SIb{k}{-}\\))\n\nHere it is assumed that the canopy storage capacity for the leaves \\(\\SIb{S_\\mathrm{leaf, max}}{mm}\\) relates linearly with \\(\\mathrm{LAI}\\) (c.f. Van Dijk and Bruijnzeel 2001). This is done via the specific leaf storage \\(S_\\mathrm{leaf}\\), a parameter that can be determined through a lookup table with land cover based on literature (Pitman 1989, Lui 1998). Next \\(S_\\mathrm{leaf, max}\\) is determined using:\n\\[\n    S_\\mathrm{leaf, max}  = S_\\mathrm{leaf}\\ \\mathrm{LAI}.\n\\]\nTo get to total storage \\(\\SIb{S_\\mathrm{canopy, max}}{mm}\\) the woody part of the vegetation also needs to be added. As for \\(S_\\mathrm{leaf}\\), the storage of the woody part \\(S_\\mathrm{wood, max}\\) can also be related to land cover (lookup table).\nThe canopy gap fraction \\(\\SIb{f_\\mathrm{canopygap}}{-}\\) is determined using the extinction coefficient \\(k\\) (van Dijk and Bruijnzeel 2001):\n\\[\n    f_\\mathrm{canopygap} = \\exp(-k\\ \\mathrm{LAI}).\n\\]\nThe extinction coefficient \\(k\\) can be related to land cover.",

Glacier modelling is very similar to snow modelling and considers two main processes: glacier build-up from snow turning into firn/ice (using the HBV-light model) and glacier melt (using a temperature degree-day model).\nThe definition of glacier boundaries and initial volume is defined by two parameters. The parameter \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{f}{glacier}}{-}\\) gives the fraction of each grid cell covered by a glacier as a number between zero and one. The state parameter glacier store \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{S}{glacier}}{mm}\\) gives the amount of water (water equivalent) within the glaciers at each grid cell. A map with \\(\\subtext{S}{glacier}\\) values can be provided as an initial state (default: \\(\\SI{5500}{mm}\\)) when the model is initialized with default values in the code (“cold” start). The required glacier data can be prepared from available glacier datasets.\nFirst, a fixed fraction \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{g}{snow\\ to\\ ice}}{t^{-1}}\\), that typically ranges between \\(0.001\\) and \\(0.006\\) for a daily time step, of snow storage \\(\\SIb{S_\\mathrm{snow}}{mm}\\) on top of the glacier is converted into ice for each time step \\(t\\) of length \\(\\Delta{t}\\) [s]:\n\\[\nS_\\mathrm{snow\\ to\\ ice} = \\mathrm{min}(g_\\mathrm{snow\\ to\\ ice} S_\\mathrm{snow}, 8 \\frac{\\Delta{t}}{\\Delta{t_b}}),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{S_\\mathrm{snow\\ to\\ ice}}{mm\\ t^{-1}}\\) is the snow into ice conversion rate, with a maximum conversion rate of \\(\\SI{8}{mm\\ d^{-1}}\\). This maximum conversion rate is scaled by \\(\\Delta{t}\\), and the model base time step size \\(\\Delta{t_b}\\) of \\(\\SIb{86,400}{s}\\).\nThe snow storage from the snow module \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{S}{snow}}{mm}\\) is then updated as follows:\n\\[\nS_\\mathrm{snow} = S_\\mathrm{snow} - S_\\mathrm{snow\\ to\\ ice}  f_\\mathrm{glacier}.\n\\]\nWhen the snowpack on top of the glacier is almost all melted (\\(S_\\mathrm{snow} &lt; \\SI{10}{mm}\\)), glacier melt is enabled and estimated with a degree-day model. If the air temperature \\(T_\\mathrm{air}\\) is above a melting temperature threshold \\(\\SIb{g_\\mathrm{melt,T threshold}}{\\degree C}\\), glacier melt occurs. The potential glacier melt \\(\\SIb{M_\\mathrm{glacier, pot}}{mm\\ t^{-1}}\\), using the degree-day factor \\(\\SIb{g_\\mathrm{ddf}}{mm\\ t^{-1}\\ \\degree C^{-1}}\\), is calculated as: \\[\n  M_\\mathrm{glacier, pot}=\\begin{cases}\n    g_\\mathrm{ddf} (T_\\mathrm{air}-g_\\mathrm{melt, T threshold}) & \\text{if $T_\\mathrm{air} &gt; g_\\mathrm{melt, T threshold}$}\\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise} .\\\\\n  \\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe actual glacier melt is limited by the glacier storage. Parameter \\(g_\\mathrm{melt, T threshold}\\) can be taken as equal to the snow \\(s_\\mathrm{melt, T threshold}\\) parameter. Values of the melting factor \\(g_\\mathrm{ddf}\\) normally varies from one glacier to another and some values are reported in the literature. \\(g_\\mathrm{ddf}\\) can also be estimated by multiplying snow \\(s_\\mathrm{ddf}\\) by a factor between \\(1\\) and \\(2\\), to take into account the higher albedo of ice compared to snow.",

    "section": "Evaporation",
    "text": "Evaporation\nThe Land Hydrology SBM model assumes the input to be potential reference evapotranspiration. A crop coefficient (set to \\(1\\) by default) is used to convert the potential evapotranspiration rate of a reference crop fully covering the soil to the potential evapotranspiration rate of vegetation (natural and agricultural) fully covering the soil. The crop coefficient is used for a surface completely covered by vegetation, and does not include the effect of growing stages of vegetation and soil cover. These effects are handled separately through the use of the canopy gap fraction.\nIt is assumed that the potential evaporation rate of intercepted water by vegetation is equal to the potential evapotranspiration rate of vegetation (fully covering the soil) multiplied by the canopy fraction. The potential evapotranspiration rate left over after interception is available for transpiration. For potential open water evaporation (river and water bodies) the potential reference evapotranspiration rate is used (multipled by the river fraction, and open water fraction). Also for potential soil evaporation the potential reference evapotranspiration rate is used, multiplied by the canopy gap fraction corrected by the sum of total water fraction (river fraction and open water fraction) and the fraction covered by a glacier.\n\nBare soil evaporation\nThe fraction of bare soil is assumed to be equal to the fraction not covered by the canopy gap fraction corrected by the total water fraction and glacier fraction. Bare soil evaporation is only provided from the upper soil layer, and soil evaporation is split in evaporation from the unsaturated store and evaporation from the saturated store. Water is first evaporated from the unsaturated store. The remaining potential soil evaporation can be used for evaporation from the saturated store, but only when the water table is present in the upper soil layer. Both the evaporation from the unsaturated store and the evaporation from the saturated store are limited by the minimum of the remaining potential soil evaporation and the available water in the unsaturated/saturated zone of the upper soil layer. The evaporation (both unsaturated and saturated) decreases linearly with decreasing water availability, as indicated by the figure below.\n\n\nCode\nusing CairoMakie\n\nlet\n  # Define colors\n  cevap = \"#ff7f00\"\n\n  # Create figure\n  fig = Figure(size=(500,300))\n  ax = Axis(\n      fig[1, 1];\n      xlabel = \"Soil moisture (θ) [-]\",\n      ylabel = \"Ratio AET/PET [-]\",\n      xticks = ([0, 1], [\"θ_empty\", \"θ_sat   \"]),\n      yticks = [0, 1],\n      xgridvisible = false,\n      ygridvisible = false,\n  )\n\n  # Plot lines\n  lines!(ax, [0, 1], [0, 1]; color = cevap)\n  lines!(ax, [0, 1], [1, 1]; color = cevap, linestyle = :dash)\n\n  # Add labels\n  text!(\n      ax,\n      \"Potential evaporation\";\n      position = (0.01, 0.99),\n      color = cevap,\n      align = (:left, :top),\n  )\n  text!(\n      ax,\n      \"Actual evaporation\";\n      position = (0.02, 0.05),\n      color = cevap,\n      align = (:left, :bottom),\n      rotation = 0.4,\n  )\n\n  # Set axis limits\n  xlims!(ax, 0, 1)\n  ylims!(ax, -0.1, 1.1)\n\n  # Display the figure\n  fig\nend\n\n\n\nEvaporation reduction as function of available soil moisture\n\n\n\n\nTranspiration\nThe maximum possible root water extraction rate for each unsaturated soil layer is determined by partitioning the potential transpiration rate \\(T_p\\) based on the fraction of the total root length density in each unsaturated soil layer. The fractions of the total root length density in each unsaturated soil layer are scaled by the inverse of the sum of these fractions. Transpiration can then be fully satisfied from the unsaturated zone first, independent of the water table that can intersect the root zone.

The root water uptake reduction model is based on the concept proposed by Feddes et al. (1978). This concept defines a reduction coefficient \\(\\SIb{\\alpha}{-}\\) as a function of soil water pressure \\(\\SIb{h}{cm}\\). Four different levels of \\(h\\) are defined: \\(h_1\\), \\(h_2\\), \\(h_3\\) and \\(h_4\\). \\(h_1\\) represents anoxic moisture conditions, \\(h_2\\) represents field capacity, \\(h_3\\) represents the point of critical soil moisture content (onset of drought stress), and \\(h_4\\) represents the wilting point. The value of \\(h_3\\) is a function of the potential transpiration rate, between \\(\\SI{1}{mm\\ d^{-1}}\\) and \\(\\SI{5}{mm\\ d^{-1}}\\). If \\(T_p \\le \\SI{1}{mm\\ d^{-1}}\\), \\(h_3\\) is set equal to \\(h_{3\\mathrm{low}}\\) (input model parameter). If \\(T_p \\ge \\SI{5}{mm d^{-1}}\\), \\(h_3\\) is set equal to \\(h_{3\\mathrm{high}}\\) (input model parameter). For \\(T_p\\) values between \\(\\SI{1}{mm\\ d^{-1}}\\) and \\(\\SI{5}{mm\\ d^{-1}}\\), the value of \\(h_3\\) is linearly related to \\(T_p\\) (between \\(h_{3\\mathrm{low}}\\) and \\(h_{3\\mathrm{high}}\\)). Besides model parameters \\(h_{3\\mathrm{high}}\\) and \\(h_{3\\mathrm{low}}\\), the critical pressure heads \\(h_1\\), \\(h_2\\) and \\(h_4\\) can be defined as input to the model.\nThe current soil water pressure is determined following the concept defined by Brooks and Corey (1964):\n\\[\n    \\frac{\\theta-\\theta_r}{\\theta_s-\\theta_r} =  \\min\\left\\{1, \\left(\\frac{h_b}{h}\\right)^\\lambda\\right\\},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{h}{cm}\\) is the pressure head, \\(\\SIb{h_b}{cm}\\) is the air entry pressure head, and \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\theta_s\\), \\(\\theta_r\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) as previously defined.\nWhenever the current soil water pressure drops below \\(h_4\\), the root water uptake is set to zero. The root water uptake is at ideal conditions whenever the soil water pressure is above \\(h_3\\), with a linear transition between \\(h_3\\) and \\(h_4\\). The assumption that very wet conditions do not affect root water uptake too much is probably generally applicable to natural vegetation. For crops this assumption is not valid and in this case root water uptake above \\(h_1\\) should be set to zero (oxygen deficit) and between \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) root water uptake is limited. This is possible by setting \\(\\alpha\\) for \\(h_1\\) at \\(0\\) (default is \\(1\\)) through model input.\n\n\nCode\nusing CairoMakie\n\nlet\n  # Create figure\n  fig = Figure(; size = (500, 400))\n  ax = Axis(\n      fig[1, 1];\n      xlabel = \"Soil water pressure head\",\n      ylabel = \"α [-]\",\n      xticks = ([0, 2, 3, 4], [\"h₄\\n-15849 cm\", \"h₃\\n-400 cm\", \"h₂\\n-100 cm\", \"h₁\\n-10 cm\"]),\n      xgridvisible = false,\n      ygridvisible = false,\n  )\n\n  # Plot line\n  lines!(ax, [0, 2, 3, 4], [0, 1, 1, 1])\n\n  # Display the figure\n  fig\n\nend\n\n\n\nRoot water uptake reduction coefficient as a function of soil water pressure\n\n\nThe computation of transpiration from the saturated store depends on the water table depth, rooting depth, the reduction coefficient \\(\\alpha\\) and the fraction of wet roots.

The remaining potential transpiration is multiplied by the wet roots fraction and \\(\\alpha\\) (and limited by the available water in saturated zone) to get the transpiration from the saturated part of the soil.\n\n\nCode\nusing CairoMakie\nusing Wflow: scurve\n\nlet\n  # Settings\n  watertable = collect(250:0.5:300)\n  rootingdepth = 275.0\n  rootdistpars = [-500.0, -1.0, -0.5, -0.3]\n\n  # Plot options\n  colors = [\"#fed98e\", \"#fe9929\", \"#d95f0e\", \"#993404\"]\n\n  # Create figure\n  fig = Figure(; size = (500, 400))\n  ax = Axis(\n      fig[1, 1];\n      xlabel = \"Fraction of wet roots [-]\",\n      ylabel = \"Water table depth [mm]\",\n      yreversed = true,  # Reverse y-axis to match water table depth orientation\n      xgridvisible = false,\n      ygridvisible = false,\n  )\n\n  # Plot lines for each rootdistpar\n  for (rootdistpar, color) in zip(rootdistpars, colors)\n      wetrootfrac = @. scurve(watertable, rootingdepth, Float64(1.0), rootdistpar)\n      lines!(ax, wetrootfrac, watertable; color = color, label = \"$rootdistpar\")\n  end\n\n  # Add rooting depth annotation\n  hlines!(ax, [rootingdepth]; linestyle = :dash, color = \"#999999\")\n  text!(\n      ax,\n      \"rootingdepth = $rootingdepth mm\";\n      position = (1.0, rootingdepth + 0.5),\n      color = \"#999999\",\n      align = (:right, :top),\n  )\n\n  # Add legend\n  axislegend(\"rootdistpar\"; position = :lt, framevisible = false)\n\n  # Set axis limits\n  ylims!(ax, maximum(watertable), minimum(watertable))  # Reverse y-axis\n  xlims!(ax, -0.05, 1.05)\n\n  # Display the figure\n  fig\nend\n\n\n\nAmount of wet roots and the effect of the rootdistpar parameter",

The top of the \\(S_\\mathrm{sat}\\) store forms a pseudo-water table at depth \\(\\SIb{z_\\mathrm{watertable}}{mm}\\) such that the value of \\(S_\\mathrm{sat}\\) at any time is given by:\n\\[\n    S_\\mathrm{sat} = (z_\\mathrm{soil}-z_\\mathrm{watertable}) (\\theta_s-\\theta_r),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{\\theta_{s}}{-}\\) and \\(\\SIb{\\theta_{r}}{-}\\) are the saturated and residual soil water contents, respectively.\nThe unsaturated storage capacity \\(\\SIb{S_\\mathrm{unsat, max}}{mm}\\) is defined as follows:\n\\[\n    S_\\mathrm{unsat, max} = z_\\mathrm{soil} (\\theta_s-\\theta_r) - S_\\mathrm{sat} - S_\\mathrm{unsat}.\n\\]\nThe saturation deficit \\(\\SIb{S_\\mathrm{deficit}}{mm}\\) for the soil profile as a whole is defined as:\n\\[\n    S_\\mathrm{deficit} = (\\theta_s-\\theta_r) z_\\mathrm{soil} - S_\\mathrm{sat}.\n\\]\nAll infiltrating water enters the unsaturated store first. The soil bucket can be split-up in different layers, by providing the thickness \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\) of the layers in the TOML file. The following example specifies three layers (from top to bottom) of \\(100\\), \\(300\\) and \\(800\\) \\(\\SI{}{mm}\\):\n[model]\nsoil_layer__thickness = [100, 300, 800]\nThe code checks for each grid cell the specified layers against the soil thickness \\(\\SIb{}{mm}\\), and adds or removes (partly) layer(s) based on the soil thickness.\nAssuming a unit head gradient, the potential transfer of water \\(\\SIb{Q_{\\mathrm{transfer,\npot,} n}}{mm\\ t^{-1}}\\) from an unsaturated layer \\(n\\) is controlled by the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity \\(\\SIb{K_{\\mathrm{vz},n}}{mm\\ t^{-1}}\\), the effective saturation degree of layer \\(n\\), and a Brooks-Corey power coefficient \\(\\SIb{c_n}{-}\\) based on the pore size distribution index \\(\\SIb{\\lambda_n}{-}\\) (Brooks and Corey, 1964) of layer \\(n\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n    Q_{\\mathrm{transfer, pot,} n} = K_{\\mathrm{vz},n}\\left(\\frac{\\theta_n-\\theta_\\mathrm{r}}{\\theta_\\mathrm{s}-\\theta_\\mathrm{r}}\\right)^{c_n}\\\\\n    c_n=\\frac{2+3\\lambda_n}{\\lambda_n}.\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nFour different saturated hydraulic conductivity depth profiles (saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile) are available and a saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile can be specified in the TOML file as follows:\n[input.static]\nsaturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile = \"exponential_constant\" # optional, one of (\"exponential\", \"exponential_constant\", \"layered\", \"layered_exponential\"), default is \"exponential\"\nSoil measurements are often available for about the upper \\(\\SI{1.5-2}{m}\\) of the soil column to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity, while these measurements are often lacking for soil depths beyond \\(\\SI{1.5-2}{m}\\).

Infiltration is determined separately for the compacted and non-compacted areas, as these have different infiltration capacities. The infiltration capacity of non-compacted areas is based on the vertical saturated conductivity at the soil surface \\(\\SIb{K_\\mathrm{v0}}{mm\\ t^{-1}}\\) and an optional multiplication factor \\(\\SIb{f_\\mathrm{Kv,\n1}}{-}\\) to correct the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the upper soil layer. Naturally, only the water that can be stored in the soil can infiltrate. If not all water can infiltrate, this is added as excess water to the runoff routing scheme.\nThe infiltrating water is split in two parts, the part that falls on compacted areas and the part that falls on non-compacted areas. The maximum infiltration rate in these areas is calculated by taking the minimum of the infiltration capacity and the infiltration rate for these areas. The actual total infiltration rate is a function of the total infiltration rate (compacted and non-compacted areas) and the initial unsaturated storage capacity.\nInfiltration excess occurs when the infiltration capacity is smaller then the water available for infiltration. This amount of water becomes overland flow (infiltration excess overland flow). Saturation excess occurs when the (upper) soil becomes saturated and water cannot infiltrate anymore. This amount of water becomes overland flow (saturation excess overland flow).\n\nInfiltration in frozen soils\nAn optional reduction factor is applied to the infiltration capacity when snow is modelled, and the model setting soil_infiltration_reduction__flag is set to true:\n[model]\nsoil_infiltration_reduction__flag = true\nsnow__flag = true\nThis reduction factor depends on the near-surface soil temperature, which is modelled based on the approach of Wigmosta et al., 2009:\n\\[\nT_\\mathrm{soil}^t = T_\\mathrm{soil}^{t-1} + w_\\mathrm{soil}  (T_\\mathrm{air} - T_\\mathrm{soil}^{t-1}),\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{T_\\mathrm{soil}^{t}}{\\degree C}\\) is the near-surface soil temperature at time step \\(t\\), \\(\\SIb{T_a}{\\degree C}\\) is air temperature at time step \\(t\\), \\(\\SIb{T_\\mathrm{soil}^{t-1}}{\\degree C}\\) is the near-surface soil temperature at the previous time step and \\(\\SIb{w_\\mathrm{soil}}{t^{-1}}\\) is a weighting coefficient determined through calibration (default is 0.1125 for daily timesteps). The optional infiltration capacity reduction factor is based on the model parameter \\(\\SIb{f_\\mathrm{red, frozen}}{-}\\) (default is 0.038) and the near-surface soil temperature as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n    b = \\frac{1.0}{1.0 - f_\\mathrm{red, frozen}}\\\\\n    f_\\mathrm{frozen} = \\frac{1.0}{b + \\exp(-c (T_\\mathrm{soil} - a))} + f_\\mathrm{red, frozen}\\\\\n    a = 0.0\\\\\n    c = 8.0.\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nA S-curve (see plot below) is used to make a smooth transition (a c-factor (\\(c\\)) of 8.0 is used):\n\n\nCode\nusing CairoMakie\nusing Wflow: infiltration_reduction_factor\n\nlet\n  # Define data\n  temps = collect(-3:0.1:3)\n  cf_soils = [0.038, 0.1, 0.2]  # Example values for cf_soil\n  colors = [\"#bae4bc\", \"#7bccc4\", \"#2b8cbe\"]  # Colors for each cf_soil\n\n  # Create figure\n  fig = Figure(; size = (500, 400))\n  ax = Axis(\n      fig[1, 1];\n      xlabel = \"Soil temperature [°C]\",\n      ylabel = \"Infiltration correction factor [-]\",\n      xgridvisible = false,\n      ygridvisible = false,\n  )\n\n  # Plot lines for each cf_soil\n  for (cf_soil, color) in zip(cf_soils, colors)\n      y_vals = @. infiltration_reduction_factor(\n          temps,\n          cf_soil;\n          modelsnow = true,\n          soil_infiltration_reduction = true,\n      )\n      lines!(ax, temps, y_vals; label = \"$cf_soil\", color = color)\n  end\n\n  # Add legend\n  axislegend(\"cf_soil\"; framevisible = false, position = :lt)\n\n  # Set axis limits\n  xlims!(ax, minimum(temps), maximum(temps))\n  ylims!(ax, -0.03, 1.03)\n\n  # Display the figure\n  fig\nend\n\n\n\nInfiltration correction factor as a function of soil temperature\n\n\n\n\n\nCapillary rise\nCapillary rise is determined when an unsaturated zone occurs in the soil column, using the following approach. First a maximum capillary rise is determined from the minimum of vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity at the water table, the actual transpiration rate from the unsaturated store and the unsaturated storage capacity. Then, the maximum capillary rate is scaled using the following empirical equation (e.g. Zammouri, 2011; Yang et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2016): \\[\n  C_\\mathrm{act}=\\begin{cases}\n    C_\\mathrm{max}\\left(1-\\frac{z_\\mathrm{watertable}}{z_\\mathrm{cap, maxdepth}}\\right)^{n_\\mathrm{cap}} & \\text{if $(z_\\mathrm{watertable}&gt;z_\\mathrm{rooting})$ \\& $(z_\\mathrm{watertable}&lt;z_\\mathrm{cap, maxdepth})$}\\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise},\n  \\end{cases}\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{C_\\mathrm{act}}{mm\\ t^{-1}}\\) is the capillary rate, \\(\\SIb{z_\\mathrm{cap,\nmaxdepth}}{mm}\\) is the critical water depth beyond which capillary rise ceases, \\(\\SIb{n_\\mathrm{cap}}{-}\\) is an empirical coefficient related to soil properties and climate, generally set between \\(1\\) and \\(3\\), \\(\\SIb{z_\\mathrm{watertable}}{mm}\\) is the water table depth and \\(\\SIb{z_\\mathrm{rooting}}{mm}\\) is the rooting depth. \\(C_\\mathrm{act}\\) is divided over the different unsaturated soil layers, from the bottom to the top unsaturated soil layer, without exceeding the saturated water content.\n\n\nLeakage\nIf the maximum leakage \\(\\SIb{}{mm\\ d^{-1}}\\) input model parameter is set &gt; 0, water is lost from the saturated zone and runs out of the model. Leakage can be enabled by specifying the following in the TOML file:\n[input.static]\nsoil_water_saturated_zone_bottom__max_leakage_volume_flux = \"maxleakage\"",

    "text": "Operational flood forecasting in Australia\nIn Australia, there was a need for high-resolution, fast and accurate rainfall-runoff models to provide boundary conditions for a fast and detailed flood inundation model (SFINCS). The domain of the flood model covers the entire North and East Coast of Australia. Although many gauging stations are available to provide real-time information, many rivers are not covered. For these locations, wflow_sbm models are used to provide this real-time information. Additionally, these models are used to provide projections for potential future scenarios. Using the HydroMT library, all wflow_sbm models were automatically built. The high level of flexibility in spatial and temporal resolution, combined with the physics-based nature of the concept, makes Wflow_sbm particularly suitable for ungauged basins. Furthermore, the model is detailed and computationally efficient enough for coupling with the fast flood inundation model SFINCS.\n\nThe results of this proof of concept are very promising. Technically, we were able to quickly set up the wflow_sbm models, couple them to the flood inundation models (SFINCS), and run the models operationally under the Delft-FEWS platform. Model validation was conducted for two basins by comparing the results of Wflow_sbm against observations and the results of calibrated URBS models. This validation demonstrated that the uncalibrated Wflow_sbm model results were already quite satisfactory, especially given the complex nature of these basins, which include several small and large reservoirs. We could also show the potential for further calibration by adjusting the KsatHorFrac parameter.\nDe Kleermaeker, S., Leijnse, T., Morales, Y., Druery, C., & Maguire, S. (2022).

    "text": "Simulating plastic transport in Thailand\nFor the Pollution Control Board of the Government of Thailand and the World Bank, we supported a material flow analysis of plastics in Thailand using wflow. Plastic pollution is a growing global issue. Plastic waste enters rivers and is transported to the ocean where it persists and threatens the health of the ocean, seas and coasts. The initial movement of plastic waste is in many cases triggered by runoff from (heavy) rainfall and transported by water flow towards small streams and rivers. Therefore there is strong relation to rainfall-runoff processes, which can be modeled using high-resolution rainfall-runoff models.\nIn this study we applied the wflow_sbm model in combination with a fate-and-transport and water quality model (DelWaq) to simulate the movement of plastics through five large river basins and on three island and coastal zones (Krabi, Phuket, and Ko Samui; see screenshot of the model below) in Thailand. Together with our partners Panya Consultants and HII, we were able to identify hotspots of plastic pollution, estimate how much plastic waste would end up in the Gulf of Thailand and recommend priority areas for reducing plastic waste reaching the sea.\n\nThe wflow_sbm models for the five large basins were calibrated. The presence of large dams and reservoirs complicated calibration, but with the input for the dam operation, the model performance for these basins could be largely improved. The figure below shows the calibrated model results for the Chao Phraya, just upstream of Bangkok. The input from the hydrological wflow_sbm model was used as input for the fate and transport model to assess the amount of plastic transported to the ocean.\n\nLink to World Bank report: https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/publication/plastic-waste-material-flow-analysis-for-thailand",

Below, we show how to install wflow from Julia’s package repository and how to install the latest version from GitHub.\nFirst, download and install the current stable release of Julia.\nIf you are new to Julia, it might be a good idea to check out the REPL. You can also find additional learning resources at julialang.org/learning.\n\nInstall from Julia’s package repository\nTo access Julia’s package manager, press ] in the Julia REPL. To get back to the Julia REPL, press backspace or ^C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t used Julia in a while, it’s a good idea to run up to update your packages.\npkg&gt; up\n\n\nTo access Julia’s package manager and install wflow, use:\npkg&gt; add Wflow\nThis process can take a while, especially on the first run, as compatible dependencies are automatically resolved and installed from the Pkg General registry.\n\n\nInstall from GitHub\nYou can also install wflow from the master branch on the repository as follows:\npkg&gt; add Wflow:Wflow#master\nThis command tracks the master branch and updates to the latest commit on that branch when you run update, or simply up, in the Pkg REPL. The add installs wflow in your home directory under .julia/packages/Wflow. Note that packages installed under packages by add should not be changed in the directory, as the change could disrupt Pkg’s automatic dependency handling.\nIf you want to modify any files in the repository, you need to do a development install. This can be done using:\npkg&gt; dev Wflow:Wflow\nThis will clone the git repository, place it under your home directory in .julia/dev/Wflow, and add the wflow package to your project environment. To receive updates, you’ll need to pull the latest changes manually using git pull. Additionally, the --local option can be passed to ensure that the package is installed in the current project environment (instead of the .julia/dev/Wflow folder).\n\n\nCheck installation of wflow\nFinally, go back to the Julia REPL and try to load wflow:\njulia&gt; using Wflow\nThe first time you do this, it may take longer as any new or changed packages need to be precompiled to enable faster loading on subsequent uses. No error messages should appear, which indicates that you have successfully installed wflow.\nBefore concluding this section, we recommend a few tools that can make using and developing Julia code easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere is a section on editors and IDEs for Julia on https://julialang.org/, scroll down to see it. We use and recommend Microsoft’s free and open source Visual Studio Code. When combined with the Julia extension it provides a powerful and interactive development experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you plan to modify the code of wflow, we recommend installing the Revise.jl package. This package allows you to modify code and use the changes without restarting Julia. Install it with add Revise from the Pkg REPL. Then create a file called .julia/config/startup.jl, and put using Revise there. This will load Revise every time you start a Julia session.",

Before the exfiltration rate was computed (function get_exfiltwater), the maximum groundwater head was adjusted to the surface level (function get_water_depth), resulting in zero exfiltration rates. The exfiltration rate computation has been moved to the update_head! function of GroundwaterFlow.\nFixed soil model SbmSoilModel cold states for model type sbm_gwf. GroundwaterFlow can have constant head boundary cells, and for river cells the initial head is set equal to the surface elevation. SbmSoilModel cold states and depending variables are now corrected based on the GroundwaterFlow initial head values.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nRefactor SimpleReservoir and Lake structs by introducing a Reservoir struct that combines data and functionality of both structs. For the simple reservoir a rating curve type (4) has been added. To represent reservoirs, (natural) lakes or other water storage features that can be represented by the available functionality the common name reservoir is used, also for the standard names of associated model variables and parameters.\nThe numerical stability coefficient for groundwater flow was set at a fixed value of 0.25 as recommended by Chu and Willis (1984). This has been changed to a configurable model setting (subsurface_water_flow__alpha_coefficient), so this can be lowered easily in case of numerical instabilities. Additionally, internal timestepping for groundwater flow is now supported.\nFor scalar NetCDF output files, when using the same output map (gauge or subcatchment map) multiple times, each variable that uses these IDs are now sharing the same dimension (instead of creating a new dimension for each variable). The name of this dimension is based on the name of the map defined in the .toml file.\nChange default value of weighting factor theta (adjusts the amount of artificial numerical diffusion) from 0.8 to 1.0 for local inertial overland flow routing. This results in smaller water balance errors.\nIntroduced in v1.0.0-rc1 (except for average water depth h_av routing), stop supporting time averaged storage variables as these are not required for typical applications and users. Additionally, rename standard names of instantaneous storage variables by removing instantaneous from the name.\nAllow static input of river external inflow.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nSupport external inflow at reservoir locations.\nInclude a SBOM in build distributions (#669).\nSupport use of reservoir observed outflow data for the reservoir water balance computation.\nSupport water mass balance computations (error and relative error).",

    "text": "v1.0.0-rc1 - 2025-06-23\n\nFixed\n\nInitialization of LateralSSF variables ssf and ssfmax with vertical hydraulic conductivity profile exponential_constant. Removed parameter khfrac from the computation, as it is already part of parameter kh_0.\nMutating BMI model control functions (update, update_until and finalize) and extended mutating BMI functions (load_state and save_state) should return nothing.\nAdded downloading of testdata to Dockerfile, to ensure an image was able to build.\nThe reservoir (reservoir_index_f) and lake (lake_index_f) indices as part of network.river were not correct. These were mapped to their own index in the SimpleReservoir and Lake struct, and not to the corresponding river index. This resulted in incorrect surface water abstractions from reservoir and lake volumes, and surface water abstractions were set at zero at the wrong river locations.\nWflow ZMQ server: allow JSON reading and writing of NaN and Inf values to avoid a JSON spec error. For example, during initialization of a wflow model, some (diagnostic) model variables are initialized with NaN values.\nLimit flux from River boundary of GroundwaterFlow to unconfined aquifer based on available river storage (from river flow routing).\nFixed computation of flow width in diagonal flow direction for model type sediment and fixed the computation of the remaining surface flow width (kinematic wave overland flow) for river cells in the diagonal flow direction. For both cases the width should be based on land area and flow length (area conservative).\nLimit external negative inflow for local inertial routing (maximum of 80% of river volume).\nAbstraction from lakes as part of water demand and allocation computations was skipped because of an incorrect if-statement.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nRemoved vertical concepts HBV and FLEXTopo.\nRemoved metadata macros (used by BMI). The variable unit is moved to the standard name mapping dictionaries, and the grid element type information is moved to a BMI helper function.\nRefactor the vertical SBM concept: divide the long struct SBM into different model components for interception, snow, glacier, (open water) runoff, soil, water demand and allocation stored in the struct LandHydrologySBM. Additionally, the atmospheric forcing and a shared vegetation parameterset are stored as separate fields in struct LandHydrologySBM (with soil model SbmSoilModel). The model component structs have model variables, parameters and boundary_conditions (if applicable), including associated functions for initializing and updating these model components. The original long update function of the SBM soil part has been split into separate functions.\nRefactor the lateral (routing) components: as for the vertical SBM concept split the structs into variables, parameters and boundary_conditions (if applicable).\nRefactor the sediment concept: similar to the refactor of SBM concept, the sediment model has been split into three main structures. SoilLoss was split into rainfall_erosion, overland_flow_erosion and (total) soil_erosion concepts. OverlandFlowSediment has been split into transport_capacity, sediment_flux and to_river concepts. RiverSediment has been split into transport_capacity, potential_erosion, sediment_flux and concentrations concepts.\nTimestepping method parameters for solving the kinematic wave and local inertial approaches for river and overland flow are moved to a TimeStepping struct. The timestepping implementation for the kinematic wave is now similar to the local inertial method: a stable timestep is computed for each sub timestep (or a fixed sub timestep is used) as part of a while loop (for each model timestep).\nMap internal model variable and parameter names based on CSDMS Standard Names. The previous one to one mapping can be used to output model variables and parameters (TOML config file), but is not considered as part of the public API.\nRefactor TOML configuration file, also as a result of using internal (CSDMS) standard names. Most important changes include: there is now a distinction between static, cyclic and forcing input ([input.static], [input.cyclic] and [input.forcing]) without the need to specify the internal cyclic and forcing variables in a list (only an external name mapping is required), state variables are listed below the [state.variables] TOML section and use of more clearly defined TOML output sections.\nReplaced the variables that can exchange through BMI (list of model components) by a list of standard names below the [API] TOML section.\nUse the instantaneous routing water depth h at the previous model time step to limit open water evaporation and to set the river stage of the GroundwaterFlow model for the current model time step, as it is more accurate then using the average water depth h_av at the previous model time step.\nRemoved LoopVectorization dependency because of compilation issues and the risk of deprecation for newer Julia versions. The tturbo macro has been replaced by the batch macro of Polyester, performance loss is acceptable.\nThe infiltration capacity of soil, represented by parameter infiltcapsoil, is now determined from the actual saturated hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface using parameters kv_0 and kvfrac, better linking it to soil properties. Setting infiltcapsoil directly by an external netCDF variable is not supported anymore.\nRemoved the GroundwaterExchange component that can be used to replace the kinematic wave lateral subsurface flow routing with an external groundwater model (e.g. Modflow). This feature has been added as part of the following MSc thesis work. One of the potential improvements recommended by this work was to re-activate the lateral subsurface flow routing for coupling with Modflow 6, as a rapid runoff (interflow) generating mechanism was missing and the current coupling did not yield satisfactory results. More work is needed to support this kind of coupling in a good way.\nRemoved default values for the following (sensitive) input parameters: khfrac, kv_0, kv, f, c, theta_s, theta_r, soilthickness, canopygapfraction, rootingdepth and pathfrac.\nChanged default values of h4 from -15849.0 to -16000.0, and cfmax from 3.75653 to 3.75.\nRemoved support for one layer models, and therefore also removed the topog_sbm_transfer__flag option. With this removal, the default soil layer thickness is set to [100, 300, 800].\nThe root length density fraction in unsaturated soil layers is scaled by using the total root length density fraction of the unsaturated zone. Plant transpiration can then be fully satisfied from the unsaturated zone when the water table intersects the root zone. For the transpiration from the saturated store the remaining potential transpiration is used in combination with the wet root fraction (root length density fraction in the saturated soil layers is not used).\nChanged order of computations for 1D-2D local inertial model that improves the accuracy of reservoir or lake state after initialization with a warm state. The inflow from land to a reservoir or lake was updated during the overland flow routing (final computation during each internal time step). This results in small inflow deviations when starting with a warm state as the inflow from land to a reservoir or lake has not been updated yet, while a reservoir or lake is updated as part of the river routing. Order of computations has been changed to: 1) overland flow routing, 2) reservoir or lake inflow and 3) river routing.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nSupport direct output of snow and glacier melt, and add computation of snow water equivalent (SWE).\nSupport computation and output of actual river water abstraction based on external negative inflow.",

Lower limit should be zero (very small negative values can occur).\nLimit lake evaporation (added variable actevap) and lake outflow to prevent negative lake storage. The variable actevap has also been added to the reservoir module.\nThe set_states function for model type sbm with local inertial routing for river and land component.\nInflow to reservoir and lake locations for local inertial routing: 1) with floodplain routing, the floodplain discharge was not added to the inflow of these locations, 2) the to_river variable from overland flow and lateral subsurface flow was not added to the inflow of these locations.\nClose netCDF NCDataset with state variables in extended BMI function save_state.\nFor the computation of Gash interception model parameter e_r multiply the precipitation input with the canopy fraction (this was only done for the potential evapotranspiration input).\nFunction BMI.update_until could throw an InexactError: Int64 caused by a not whole number, representing how many times (steps) an update of a wflow model is required. This is fixed by using divrem for the computation of the number of steps in this function. An error is thrown when the absolute remainder of divrem is larger than eps(), or when the number of steps is negative.\nFixed internal and external broken links in docs.\nThe internal time step of the local inertial model (stable_timestep function) can get zero when LoopVectorization is applied (@tturbo) to the for loop of these functions. This issue occured on a virtual machine, Windows 10 Enterprise, with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6144 CPU (2 processors). This has been fixed by replacing @tturbo with reduction of Polyester.jl.\nFixed required states of the model type sbm_gwf: added h_av for the river and land domain.\nFor the constanthead boundary of GroundwaterFlow the head should not be changed (was set to top elevation of the aquifer if head &gt; top), and exfiltwater should be 0 for these boundary cells.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nStop exposing scalar variables through BMI. The BMI.get_value_ptr function was not working correctly for scalar model variables (a view was applied). Only a few scalar model parameters are defined, and it is not expected that exposing these variables is required (e.g. for model coupling) while code changes for these variables (including struct fields) are required.\nThe local inertial routing (constant) river boundary condition depth at a ghost node (downstream river outlet) was set at 0.0 in the code and can now be provided through the model parameter netCDF file (riverdepth_bc). In addition, the boundary condition river length dl at a ghost node should be set through the model parameter netCDF file (riverlength_bc), providing this boundary condition through the [model] settings in the TOML file (model.riverlength_bc) has been deprecated.\nAs part of the vertical SBM concept: 1) add variable net_runoff (land runoff minus actual open water evaporation ae_openw_l) and 2) change the definition of variable runoff by removing the subtraction of ae_openw_l (total land runoff). The variable net_runoff is now input to the kinematic wave for overland flow (replaces the original runoff variable as input). The lower limit of the original runoff variable was set at zero, which may result in water balance errors. This lower limit was implemented in the Python version of wflow_sbm, to avoid a very slow kinematic wave solution for surface flow computation (no distinction between a kinematic wave for overland and river flow). When in the Python version of wflow_sbm the kinematic wave for surface flow was split into a river and land component, the lower limit was removed for river runoff (net_runoff_river), but not for land runoff.\nAlways use fractions for the computation of potential evapotranspiration (interception and transpiration) and potential evaporation (open water and soil). Replaced variable et_reftopot by crop coefficient kc (use of et_reftopot has been deprecated).\nFor improved code readability it is now discouraged to use non-ASCII characters for the names of variables, structs, functions and macros. Using the non-ASCII character for built-in operators is still allowed. This change in naming convention is now in effect and all invalid uses of non-ASCII characters have been replaced by ASCII equivalents. This change also impacts the TOML keys kv₀, θᵣ and θₛ. These keys have been replaced with the ASCII versions kv_0, theta_r and theta_s in v0.4.0 and the old keys are not supported anymore.\nDocs: 1) improved description of different model configurations in model-setup.md, also in relation to hydromt_wflow in docs, 2) citing info related to wflow_sbm publication in Geosci. Model Dev. (from in review to published).\nRoot water uptake reduction (Feddes): 1) extend critical pressure head parameters with h3_low and h3_high, 2) all critical pressure head parameters can be set (values for h1, h2 and h3 were fixed) and 3) the root water uptake reduction coefficient \\alpha can be set at 0 (default is 1) at critical pressure head h1 (through the model parameter alpha_h1).\nFor the actual transpiration computation in SBM, the potential transpiration is partitioned over the soil layers with roots according to the model parameter rootfraction (fraction of the total root length in a soil layer). Previously, for each soil layer (from top to bottom) the actual transpiration was computed, and the remaining potential transpiration was used in the next soil layer.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nTotal water storage as an export variable for SBM concept. This is the total water stored per grid cell in millimeters. Excluded from this variable are the floodplain, lakes and reservoirs.\nChecks to see if all states are covered in the .toml file. If not all states are covered, an error is thrown. If there are more states specified than required, these states are ignored (with a warning in the logging), and the simulation will continue.\nSupport different vertical hydraulic conductivity profiles for the SBM concept. See also the following sections: The SBM soil water accounting scheme and Subsurface flow routing for a short description.\nLocal inertial routing to sbm_gwf model type.\nWater demand and allocation computations for model types sbm and sbm_gwf.\n\n\n\n\nv0.7.3 - 2024-01-12\n\nFixed\n\nDocumentation: add leakage term to the wflow_sbm figure, document external input parameter ksathorfrac and fix description of adding external inflow to the kinematic wave.\nFixed BMI functions (e.g. BMI.get_value) that deviated from BMI specifications (BasicModelInterface.jl), including function arguments, return types and the BMI specification that arrays are always flattened (this was not the case for variables stored as 2-dimensional arrays or as vector of SVectors).\nBump compat for NCDatasets to 0.13, 0.14.\nThe solution for lake outflow as part of the Modified Puls Approach. The inflow and outflow variables are defined for period Δt, and not at t1 and t2 (instantaneous) as in the original mass balance equation of the Modified Puls Approach. Because of this, the terms of the quadratic equation (and solution) were fixed.\nUse kvfrac for the computation of vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the soil layer, since kvfrac is also used for the computation of vertical unsaturated flow.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nFor cyclic parameters different cyclic time inputs are supported (only one common cyclic time (for example daily or monthly) was allowed).\nBMI: 1) added grid information (type and location) and whether a variable can be exchanged to metadata Structs, 2) extend model grid functions for wflow components that store variables on edges (local inertial model) with get_grid_edge_count and get_grid_edge_nodes.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nFunctions for loading and saving states and getting the starttime in Unix time format. This is convenient for coupling with OpenDA (and other external) software. The set states functionality from the initialization function has been moved to a separate set_states function for each Model type, to support loading states independent of initialization.\n\n\n\n\nv0.7.2 - 2023-09-27\n\nFixed\n\nWater balance of modified Rutter interception model. The sum of the stemflow partitioning coefficient pt and free throughfall coefficient p could get larger than 1, resulting in an overestimation of stemflow and throughfall amounts and negative net interception amounts. And the first drainage amount dd, controlled by a change over time in canopy storage capacity cmax, should not be subtracted from precipitation to compute net interception.\nThe netinterception (net interception) computed by the modified Rutter interception model was stored as interception in SBM, while this should be the interception (interception loss by evaporation) output of the modified Rutter interception model. The interception of SBM is used to compute the total actual evapotranspiration actevap.\n\n\n\n\nv0.7.1 - 2023-06-30\n\nFixed\n\nState initialization of 1D floodplain volume. In the initialization function the wrong field name of type FloodPlainProfile was used (area instead of a).\n\n\n\n\nv0.7.0 - 2023-06-12\n\nFixed\n\nBMI.get_time_units now gets called on the model rather than the type, like all other BMI functions, except BMI.initialize. Also it returns “s” instead of “seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00”, in line with the BMI specification.\nAdded the interception component to total actual evapotranspiration actevap of SBM (was defined as the sum of soil evaporation, transpiration and open water evaporation).\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nThe time values returned in the BMI interface are no longer in seconds since 1970, but in seconds since the model start time. This is more in line with standard BMI practices.\nThe starttime was defined one model timestep Δt ahead of the actual model time (the initial conditions timestamp (state time)). As a consequence this was also the case for the current model time. To allow for an easier interpretation of wflow time handling, either through BMI or directly, the starttime is now equal to the state time, resulting in current model times without an offset.\nUsing more than 8 threads can result in too much overhead with Threads.@threads. After performance testing, this has been changed for kinematic wave routing and the vertical SBM concept to spawning tasks with Threads@spawn for number of threads &lt;= 8, where each task iterates over a chunk of size basesize. For more than 8 threads the low overhead threading Polyester.@batch (including the minbatch argument) is used. For local inertial routing the use of Threads.@threads has been changed to threaded loop vectorization (river and 1D floodplain local inertial momentum equation) and Polyester.@batch.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nFor (regulated) lakes with rating curve of type 1 (H-Q table), lake storage above the maximumstorage (based on maximum water level from the H-Q table) is spilled instantaneously (overflow) from the lake.\nAdded support to use sum as a reducer function for csv and scalar output options.\n\n\n\n\nv0.6.3 - 2023-03-01\n\nFixed\n\nRemoved error when _FillValue is present in the time dimension of the forcing netCDF file. The simulation is allowed to continue with the attribute present, given that there are no missing values in the time dimension. This is checked by the code, and an error is thrown if this is the case.\nColumn index of daily lake rating curves. This was incorrectly based on dayofyear with a maximum of 365. The column index should be based on julian day (leap days are not counted).\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nNCDatasets version. Reading the time dimension of multifile netCDF file became very slow since NCDatasets v0.12.4, this issue has been solved in v0.12.11.\nStore the time dimension of the forcing netCDF file as part of the struct NCreader instead of calling dataset[\"time\"][:] each time step when loading forcing data.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nShow total duration of simulation in the log file (info), and show the current time at execution of each timestep (debug).\nSupport for exponential decline in horizontal conductivity in the sbm_gwf concept. This can be enabled using the conductivity_profile setting (either “uniform” or “exponential”). If set to “exponential”, it exponentially reduces the kh0 (or conductivity) based on the value of gwf_f to the actual horizontal conductivity (k).\nAn optional 1D floodplain schematization for the river flow inertial model, based on provided flood volumes as a function of flood depth per river cell. See also the following sections: SBM + Local inertial river and River and floodplain routing for a short description, and the following section for associated model parameters.\n\n\n\n\nv0.6.2 - 2022-09-01\n\nFixed\n\nTwo issues related to reservoir and lake locations as part of local inertial model: 1) added as boundary points to the update of overland flow, 2) fixed check reservoir and lake location in update river flow.\nLimit flow (qx, qy and q) in local inertial model when water is not available (set to zero).\nIn the grid output netCDFs, don’t set the _FillValue attribute, since the CF conventions don’t allow it.\nGlacier parameter g_sifrac needs to be converted during initialization (time dependent).\nThe check that the sum of adaptive timesteps (Δt) of the local inertial model (1D and 2D) does not exceed the model timestep.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nChanged depth h for reservoir and lake locations as part of the river local inertial model from bankfull_depth to zero.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nExternal inflow to the SBM + Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D) model configuration.\n\n\n\n\nv0.6.1 - 2022-04-26\n\nFixed\n\nFixed an error with the log file, when writing to a folder that does not (yet) exists. Now, the folder is created prior to writing the log file.\nFixed a MethodError for read_dims, thrown when reading netCDF data with NCDatasets.jl 0.12.3 or higher.\n\n\n\n\nv0.6.0 - 2022-04-14\n\nAdded\n\nThe FLEXTopo model.\nSet a (different) uniform value for each index of input parameters with an extra dimension. A list of values (instead of one uniform value) that should be equal to the length of the extra dimension can be provided in the TOML file. See also Modify parameters.\nModify input parameters with an extra dimension at multiple indices with different scale and offset values, through the TOML file. See also Modify parameters.\nAdded support for netCDF compression for gridded model output, through the option compressionlevel in the [output] section in the TOML file. The setting defaults to 0 (no compression), but all levels between 0 and 9 can be used.\n\n\n\nChanged\n\nRe-organized the documentation: moved explanation of different model concepts to a model documentation section, added a user guide to explain setting up the model, added new figures to the description of wflow_sbm.\nThe unit of lateral subsurface flow ssf of LateralSSF is now m^3 d^{-1}. The unit was m^3 t^{-1}, where t is the model timestep. Other flow variables are already stored independently from t, this allows for easier interpretation and to use states independently of t.\nChanged the reference level of water depth h and h_av of 2D overland flow (ShallowWaterLand) for cells containing a river from river bed elevation zb to cell elevation z.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nFixed calculation of average water depth h_av of 2D overland flow (ShallowWaterLand) with the local inertial approach. The summation of h was not correct, resulting in too low values for h_av. For river cells of 2D overland flow h_av was only updated as part of the river domain (ShallowWaterRiver), this value is now also updated as part of the land domain (ShallowWaterLand).\nFixed the following two flow width issues for 2D overland flow of the local inertial model: 1) The flow widths xwidth and ywidth were mapped incorrectly (reversed) to the flow calculation in x and y direction, respectively. 2) For river cells the effective flow width for overland flow was not determined correctly: the riverwidth vector supplied to the function set_effective_flowwidth! covered the complete model domain and should have covered the river domain, resulting in incorrect river widths and thus incorrect effective flow widths for river cells.\n\n\n\n\nv0.5.2 - 2022-02-03\n\nChanged\n\nModel types sbm_gwf and hbv use the same approach for the calculation of the drain width dw as model type sbm.\nRenamed h_bankfull parameter to bankfull_depth for consistency between kinematic-wave and local-inertial river routing. When using the old name under the [input.lateral.river] section of the TOML file, it will work but it is suggested to update the name.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nAdditional log messages and log file as output, see also Logging.\nOption to use the local inertial model for river flow as part of the sbm model type. See also SBM + Local inertial river.\nOption to use the local inertial model for 1D river flow combined with 2D overland flow as part of the sbm model type. See also SBM + Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D).\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nModel type hbv: the surface width for overland flow was not corrected with the river width.\nFixed use of absolute path for path_forcing in TOML file, which gave an error in wflow v0.5.1.\nFixed a crash when glacier processes are simulated as part of the hbv concept (Δt was not defined).\nWhen the surface flow width for overland flow is zero, the water level h of the kinematic wave should not be calculated, otherwise this results in NaN values. When the model is initialized from state files, q and h are set to zero for indices with a zero surface flow width.\nFixed how number of iterations its for kinematic wave river flow are calculated during initialization when using a fixed sub-timestep (specified in the TOML file). For a model timestep smaller than the fixed sub-timestep an InexactError was thrown.\nFixed providing a cyclic parameter when the netCDF variable is read during model initialization with ncread, this gave an error about the size of the netCDF time dimension.\nFixed CSV and netCDF scalar output of variables with dimension layer (SVector).\n\n\n\n\nv0.5.1 - 2021-11-24\n\nFixed\n\nFixed calculation of exfiltwater as part of the sbm_gwf model type. This was based directly on groundwater head above the surface level, without multiplying by the specific_yield, resulting in an overestimation of exfiltwater. This is required since the groundwater model estimates the head by dividing the volume by the specific yield or storativity of the aquifer. So, should the groundwater table rise above surface level, the head above surface level does not represent a water column one to one. (This also means the groundwater model (slightly) overestimates heads when the head rises above the surface level. However, this water is immediately removed, and the head will be set to surface level.)\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nOptional dir_input and dir_output keys in the TOML, which can be used to quickly change the path for all input or output files that are given as a relative path.\n\n\n\n\nv0.5.0 - 2021-11-12\n\nChanged\n\nScaling of potential capillary rise is replaced by a common approach found in literature, based on the water table depth zi, a maximum water depth cap_hmax beyond which capillary rise ceases, and a coefficient cap_n. See also Capillary rise. Multiplying the scaling factor with the ratio of model time step and basetimestep in the original approach resulted in (much) smaller capillary fluxes at sub-daily model time steps compared to daily model time steps, and is not used in the new approach. Parameters cap_hmax and cap_n can be set through the TOML file, parameter capscale of the previous approach is not used anymore.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nConversion of GroundwaterFlow boundaries \\(\\SIb{}{m^3 d^{-1}}\\) as part of model concept sbm_gwf to \\(\\SI{m^3 s^{-1}}\\) for sub-daily model time steps. For the conversion the basetimestep (86400 s) should be used (and not the model time step).\n\n\n\n\nv0.4.1 - 2021-11-04\n\nChanged\n\nThe \\alpha parameter of the kinematic wave has a fixed value now and is not updated because of changes in water height (this could result in large water balance errors). See also Surface routing.\nCyclic input for other structs than vertical are also now supported (for example cyclic inflow to the river).\nMoved update_forcing! and update_cyclic! functions to the run function. It is now easier to implement a custom run function with custom loading of input data (forcing and cyclic parameters).\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nCheck if reservoirs and lakes have downstream nodes. Without downstream nodes is not supported and in that case an error message is thrown that is easier to understand than the previous one: “ArgumentError: Collection is empty, must contain exactly 1 element.”\nFor the input.path_forcing TOML setting we use Glob.jl to expand strings like \"data/forcing-year-*.nc\" to a set of netCDF files that are split in time.\nExternal water inflow (supply/abstractions) added to the kinematic wave inflow in m3/s. It is added/removed to sf.qlat[v] before computing the new q[v] with the kinematic wave equation.\nFixed values for forcing parameters are supported, see also Fixed forcing values.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nOption to use the local inertial model for river flow as part of the SBM + Kinematic wave. See also SBM + Local inertial river.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nRiver inflow for reservoirs and lakes in the kinematic wave. This inflow was based on sf.q[v] at the previous time step, and this has been fixed to the current time step.\n\n\n\n\nv0.4.0 - 2021-09-02\n\nChanged\n\nChanged length units for lateral subsurface flow component from millimeter to meter. This means that state netCDF files from previous versions can only be reused if ssf is divided by 10^9.\nAdd snow and glacier processes to wflow_sbm figure of the documentation.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nMulti-threading of vertical SBM concept and lateral kinematic wave components (overland, river and subsurface flow) of wflow_sbm model SBM + Kinematic wave.\nImproved error message for CSV Reducer.\nThe TOML keys kv₀, θᵣ and θₛ have been replaced with the ASCII versions kv_0, theta_r and theta_s, to avoid encoding issues with certain text editors. The old keys still work as well.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nCalculation of volumetric water content of vertical SBM (soil layers and root zone).\nUpdate of satwaterdepth in SBM (evaporation was only subtracted from a local variable, and not from sbm.satwaterdepth).\nFixed the index lowerlake_ind of NaturalLake. Linked lakes were not simulated correctly (flows between upstream and downstream lake).\nInterpolation function interpolate_linear(x, xp, fp) for CSV tables lakes. When x was larger or smaller than xp, maximum(xp) or minimum(xp) was returned instead of maximum(fp) or minimum(fp).\nFixed model timestep of reservoirs (SimpleReservoir) and lakes (NaturalLake) in relation to precipitation and evapotranspiration fluxes. This was set to the fixed wflow basetimestep of 86400 s, and should be set to the actual model time step from the TOML configuration file.\nAdd flux from Drainage (GroundwaterFlow) in the sbm_gwf_model to the overland flow component instead of the river component of the kinematic wave.\nFixed option constanthead = false (TOML file), constant_head field of GroundwaterFlow was not defined in this case. Fixed this by initializing empty fields (Vector) for struct ConstantHead.\nFixed return max(0, boundary.flux[index]) to return max(0, flux) the flux should be returned when cell is dry, no negative value allowed.\nFixed path to initialize lake to: dirname(static_path)\nFixed outflow = 0, when lake level is below lake threshold. Before a negative value could enter the log function and model would fail.\nFixed the lake storage initialization. For continuation runs (reinit = false), this caused the lake to be reset to the initial conditions instead of the saved state.\n\n\n\n\nv0.3.1 - 2021-05-19\n\nFixed\n\nIgnore extra dimensions in input netCDFs if they are size 1\n\n\n\n\nv0.3.0 - 2021-05-10\n\nChanged\n\nNew deposition process for coarse sediment in the reservoirs with a new parameter restrapefficiency in the sediment model.\nNew variables added to the LandSediment and RiverSediment structs in order to save more output from the sediment model.\nAdded variables volume and inwater to SurfaceFlow struct, this is convenient for the coupling with the water quality model Delwaq.\nRiver water level (h) and discharge (q) forced directly into the RiverSediment struct (instead of using the OverlandFlowSediment struct first).\nRequire Julia 1.6 or later.\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nModify model parameters and forcing through the TOML file (see Modify parameters).\nRun wflow_sbm (SBM + kinematic wave) in two parts (until recharge and after subsurface flow) from BMI, including the option to switch off the lateral subsurface component of wflow_sbm.\nSupport more netCDF dimension and axis order variants.\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nCorrected a bug in sediment deposition in the river (case when incoming sediment load is more than the river transport capacity).\nFixed update of snow and glacierstore fields of HBV and SBM concepts by the glacier_hbv module.\n\n\n\n\nv0.2.0 - 2021-03-26\n\nChanged\n\nRemoved dependency of the f model parameter of wflow_sbm on the parameters \\theta_{s}, \\theta_{r} and M. This approach is used in Topog_SBM, but not applicable for wflow_sbm. The f parameter needs to be provided as part of the netCDF model parameter file.\nGrid properties as cell length and elevation now stored as part of the model.land.network component and not as part of the vertical model components, as it is not used by these components. altitude (elevation) should now be provided as part of the [input] section of the TOML configuration file, and not as part of the [input.vertical] section.\nRemoved parameter \\theta_{e} from SBM struct (not used in update). Parameters \\theta_{s} and \\theta_{r} included separately (instead of \\theta_{e}) in LateralSSF struct, now directly linked to SBM parameters.\nImprove error messages (netCDF and cyclic flow graph).\n\n\n\nAdded\n\nExport of netCDF scalar timeseries (separate netCDF file from gridded timeseries). This also allows for importing these timeseries by Delft-FEWS (General Adapter).\n\n\n\nFixed\n\nModel parameter Manning’s n now used during the update of the struct SurfaceFlow, to change the related \\alpha parameter of the kinematic wave for channel flow.",

    "section": "Data requirements",
    "text": "Data requirements\nThe actual data requirements depend on the application of the Model and the Model type. Both forcing and static data should be provided in netCDF format, with the same grid definition for forcing and static data. The only exception is storage and rating curves for reservoir nodes, that should be provided in CSV format, see also Storage and rating cuves from data.\n\nForcing data:\n\nPrecipitation\nPotential evapotranspiration\nTemperature (optional, only needed for snow and glacier modelling)\n\n\nThe requirements for static data (including model parameters) depend on the model type. The following data is required for all model types, but not directly part of a model component:\n\nflow direction data (D8)\nriver map (location of the river)\nsub-catchment map (model domain)\n\nFor the flow direction (D8) data, the PCRaster ldd convention is used, see also PCRaster ldd. An approach to generate ldd data is to make use of the Python package pyflwdir:\n\nto upscale existing flow direction data as the 3 arcsec MERIT Hydro data (Yamazaki et al., 2019)\nor to derive flow directions from elevation data,\n\nsee also Eilander et al. (2021) for more information. Pyflwdir is also used by the hydroMT Python package described in the next paragraph. Another approach to generate ldd data is to make use of PCRaster functionality, see for example lddcreate.\nOptionally, but also not directly part of a model component are gauge locations, that are used to extract gridded data from certain locations, and reservoir locations and areas (coverage).\nThe different supported model configurations are described in the section Model configurations. Wflow_sbm models have the Land Hydrology SBM model in common and input parameters for this model are described in the list of parameters and variables of this model. For wflow_sbm models there are two ways to include subsurface flow:\n\nThe kinematic wave approach (see section Subsurface flow routing) as part of the sbm model type. Parameters that are part of this component are described in the Lateral subsurface flow section. Input parameters for this component are derived from the soil model of the Land Hydrology SBM model (soil__thickness [mm], soil_water__saturated_volume_fraction [-] and soil_water__residual_volume_fraction [-]) and the land slope land_surface__slope input parameter. The parameter subsurface_water__horizontal_to_vertical_saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_ratio [-] is used to calculate the horizontal hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface kh_0.\nGroundwater flow (see section Groundwater flow component) as part of the sbm_gwf model type. For the unconfined aquifer the input parameters are described in the section Unconfined aquifer. The bottom (bottom) of the groundwater layer is derived from the provided soil__thickness [mm] and surface elevation land_surface__elevation [m] parameters as part of the static input. The area parameter is derived from the model grid. Parameters that are part of the boundary conditions of the unconfined aquifer are listed under Constant Head and Boundary conditions sections.\n\nThe default wflow_sbm model routing configuration makes use of the kinematic wave surface routing (river flow, overland flow or both) and input data required for the river and overland flow components is described in Surface flow. There is also the option to use the local inertial model as part of the wflow_sbm models (model types sbm and sbm_gwf):\n\nfor river flow, see also the Local inertial river and floodplain model.\nfor 1D river flow and 2D overland flow combined, see also the Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D) model.\n\nInput parameters for this approach are listed under River flow (local inertial), including the optional 1D floodplain schematization, and Overland flow (local inertial) sections.\nReservoir nodes representing reservoirs, (natural) lakes or other water storage features can be part of the kinematic wave or local inertial model for river flow and input parameters are listed under the Reservoirs section.\nThe wflow_sediment model configuration consists of the Soil Erosion concept and the input parameters for this concept are listed under the Sediment section. The parameters of the routing Sediment Flux in overland flow concept are listed under the Overland flow section. The input parameters of the routing concept River Sediment Model are listed under the River flow section.\nExample models can be found in the Example models section.",

    "text": "Using the command line interface\nIf you don’t need the extra features of using wflow as a library, but just want to run simulations, the command line interface makes it easier to do so. It consists of a single executable, wflow_cli that accepts a single argument, the path to a TOML configuration file.\nBinaries of wflow_cli can be downloaded from our website download.deltares.nl, and are currently available for Windows.\nAfter installing you can see three folders in the installation directory. It is only the bin/wflow_cli that is directly used. All three folders need to stay together however. The share folder contains TOML files with more information about the build.\nbin\\wflow_cli\nlib\nshare\nSimply running wflow_cli with no arguments will give the following message:\nUsage: wflow_cli \"path/to/config.toml\"\nNote that this only works if the bin folder is in your PATH. If you want to run it from any directory, you can add the bin folder to your PATH. Alternatively, you can run it from any location by specifying the full path to the executable. For example (but please adjust the path to your own installation):\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Deltares\\wflow\\wflow x.x.x\\wflow_cli\\bin\\wflow_cli.exe\" \"path/to/config.toml\"\nWhen starting a run, you will see basic run information on the screen, as well as a progress bar, that gives an estimate of how much time is needed to finish the simulation:\n┌ Info: Run information\n│   model_type = \"sbm\"\n│   starttime = CFTime.DateTimeStandard(2000-01-01T00:00:00)\n│   dt = 86400 seconds\n│   endtime = CFTime.DateTimeStandard(2000-12-31T00:00:00)\n└   nthreads() = 4\n\nProgress: 100%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████| Time: 0:00:27",

    "text": "Over the land, soil erosion, also called soil loss, is closely linked to the water cycle. The main processes governing sediment generation are splash erosion from rain droplets, and sheet and rill erosion from the shear stress caused by overland flow. The intensity of soil erosion by rain or ﬂow depends on the land and soil characteristics such as slope, land use or soil type. Once soil is eroded, the detached particles can be transported downslope by overland ﬂow. Along the transport pathways, soil particles can also be deposited due to a low flow velocity, a change of topography in depressions, footslopes or valley bottoms, and/or can be filtered and stopped by a change in vegetation such as ﬁeld boundaries.\nThe inland part of the sediment gathers these different processes, separated in a structure for the soil loss and routing structure for the transport in overland flow.",

    "text": "Soil Erosion\nThe first process to consider in sediment dynamics is the generation of sediments by land erosion. The main processes behind soil loss are rainfall erosion and overland flow erosion. In order to model such processes at a fine time and space scale, physics-based models such as ANSWERS and EUROSEM were chosen here.\nThe choice of rainfall erosion model is set up in the model section of the TOML:\n[model]\nrainfall_erosion = \"answers\" # Rainfall erosion model: [\"answers\", \"eurosem\"]\n\nRainfall erosion\nIn wflow_sediment, rainfall erosion can both be modelled using EUROSEM or ANSWERS equation. The main difference between the models is that EUROSEM uses a more physics-based approach based on the kinetic energy of the rain drops impacting the soil (Morgan et al, 1998), while ANSWERS is more empirical and uses parameters from the USLE model (Beasley et al, 1991).\nIn EUROSEM, rainfall erosion is modelled according to rainfall intensity and its kinetic energy when it reaches the soil according to equations developed by Brandt (1990). As the intensity of the rain kinetic energy depends on the length of the fall, rainfall intercepted by vegetation will then be reduced compared to direct throughfall. The kinetic energy of direct throughfall is estimated by (Morgan et al, 1998): \\[\n   \\subtext{\\mathrm{KE}}{direct} = 8.95 + 8.44\\,\\log_{10}(R_i)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{KE}}{direct}}{J\\ m^{-2}\\ mm^{-1}}\\) is the kinetic energy of direct throughfall and \\(\\SIb{R_i}{mm\\ h^{-1}}\\) is rainfall intensity. If the rainfall is intercepted by vegetation and falls as leaf drainage, its kinetic energy is then reduced according to (Brandt, 1990): \\[\n   \\subtext{\\mathrm{KE}}{leaf} = 15.8\\,\\sqrt{H_p} - 5.87\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{\\subtext{\\mathrm{KE}}{leaf}}{J\\ m^{-2}\\ mm^{-1}}\\) is kinetic energy of leaf drainage and \\(\\SIb{H_p}{m}\\) is the effective canopy height (half of plant height). Canopy height can be derived from the global map from Simard & al. (2011) or by user input depending on the land use.\nKinetic energies from both direct throughfall and leaf drainage are then multiplied by the respective depths of direct throughfall and leaf drainage (mm) and added to get the total rainfall kinetic energy \\(\\mathrm{KE}\\). The soil detached by rainfall \\(\\SIb{D_R}{g\\ m^{-2}}\\) is then: \\[\n   D_R = k\\,\\mathrm{KE}\\,e^{-\\varphi h}\n\\] where \\(\\SIb{k}{g\\ J^{-1}}\\) is an index of the detachability of the soil, \\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{KE}}{J\\ m^{-2}}\\) is the total rainfall kinetic energy, \\(\\SIb{h}{m}\\) is the surface runoff depth on the soil and \\(\\varphi\\) is an exponent varying between \\(0.9\\) and \\(3.1\\) used to reduce rainfall impact if the soil is already covered by water. As a simplification, Torri (1987) has shown that a value of \\(2.0\\) for \\(\\varphi\\) is representative enough for a wide range of soil conditions. The detachability of the soil \\(k\\) depends on the soil texture (proportion of clay, silt and sand content) and corresponding values are defined in EUROSEM user guide (Morgan et al, 1998). As a simplification, in wflow_sediment, the mean value of the detachability shown in the table below are used. Soil texture can for example be derived from the topsoil clay and silt content from SoilGrids (Hengl et al, 2017).\n\nMean detachability of soil depending on its texture (Morgan et al, 1998).\n\n\nTexture (USDA system)\nMean detachability \\(\\SIb{k}{g\\ J^{-1}}\\)\n\n\n\n\nClay\n2.0\n\n\nClay Loam\n1.7\n\n\nSilt\n1.2\n\n\nSilt Loam\n1.5\n\n\nLoam\n2.0\n\n\nSandy Loam\n2.6\n\n\nLoamy Sand\n3.0\n\n\nFine Sand\n3.5\n\n\nSand\n1.9\n\n\n\nRainfall erosion is handled differently in ANSWERS. There, the impacts of vegetation and soil properties are handled through the USLE coefficients in the equation (Beasley et al, 1991):\n\\[\n   D_R = 0.108 \\, \\subtext{C}{USLE} \\, \\subtext{K}{USLE} \\, A_i \\, R_i^2\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{D_R}{kg\\ min^{-1}}\\) is the soil detachment by rainfall, \\(\\subtext{C}{USLE}\\) is the soil cover-management factor from the USLE equation, \\(\\subtext{K}{USLE}\\) is the soil erodibility factor from the USLE equation, \\(\\SIb{A_i}{m^2}\\) is the area of the cell and \\(\\SIb{R_i}{mm\\ min^{-1}}\\) is the rainfall intensity. There are several methods available to estimate the \\(C\\) and \\(K\\) factors from the USLE. They can come from user input maps, for example maps resulting from Panagos & al.’s recent studies for Europe (Panagos et al, 2015) (Ballabio et al, 2016). To get an estimate of the \\(C\\) factor globally, the other method is to estimate \\(C\\) values for the different land use type in from global land cover maps (e.g. GlobCover). An example is given for the global land cover map GlobCover, summed up in the table below, the values come from a literature study including Panagos et al.’s review (2015), Gericke & al. (2015), Mansoor & al. (2013), Chadli et al. (2016), de Vente et al. (2009), Borrelli et al. (2014), Yang et al. (2003) and Bosco et al. (2015).\nThe other methods to estimate the USLE \\(K\\) factor are to use either topsoil composition or topsoil geometric mean diameter. \\(K\\) estimation from topsoil composition is estimated with the equation developed in the EPIC model (Williams et al, 1983):\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n   \\subtext{K}{USLE} = \\left[ 0.2 + 0.3\\exp\\left(-0.0256\\;\\mathrm{SAN}\\frac{(1-\\mathrm{SIL})}{100}\\right) \\right]\n   \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{SIL}}{\\mathrm{CLA}+\\mathrm{SIL}}\\right)^{0.3} \\\\\n   \\left(1-\\frac{0.25\\;\\mathrm{OC}}{\\mathrm{OC}+e^{3.72-2.95\\;\\mathrm{OC}}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{0.75\\;\\mathrm{SN}}{\\mathrm{SN}+e^{-5.51+22.9\\;\\mathrm{SN}}}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{CLA}}{\\%}\\), \\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{SIL}}{\\%}\\), \\(\\SIb{\\mathrm{SAN}}{\\%}\\) are respectively the clay, silt and sand fractions of the topsoil, \\(\\SIb{OC}{\\%}\\) is the topsoil organic carbon content and \\(\\mathrm{SN} = 1-\\mathrm{SAN}/100\\). These soil parameters can be derived for example from the SoilGrids dataset. The \\(K\\) factor can also be estimated from the soil mean geometric diameter using the formulation from the RUSLE guide by Renard & al. (1997):\n\\[\n   \\subtext{K}{USLE} = 0.0034 + 0.0405\\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{\\log_{10}(D_g)+1.659}{0.7101}\\right)^2\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(D_g\\) is the soil geometric mean diameter (mm) estimated from topsoil clay, silt, sand fraction.\n\nEstimation of USLE C factor per Globcover land use type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobCover Value\nGlobcover label\n\\(\\subtext{C}{USLE}\\)\n\n\n\n\n11\nPost-flooding or irrigated croplands (or aquatic)\n0.2\n\n\n14\nRainfed croplands\n0.35\n\n\n20\nMosaic cropland (50-70%) vegetation (grassland/shrubland/forest) (20-50%)\n0.27\n\n\n30\nMosaic vegetation (grassland/shrubland/forest) (50-70%) / cropland (20-50%)\n0.25\n\n\n40\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) broadleaved evergreen or semi-deciduous forest (&gt;5m)\n0.0065\n\n\n50\nClosed (&gt;40%) broadleaved deciduous forest (&gt;5m)\n0.001\n\n\n60\nOpen (15-40%) broadleaved deciduous forest/woodland (&gt;5m)\n0.01\n\n\n70\nClosed (&gt;40%) needleleaved evergreen forest (&gt;5m)\n0.001\n\n\n90\nOpen (15-40%) needleleaved deciduous or evergreen forest (&gt;5m)\n0.01\n\n\n100\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) mixed broadleaved and needleleaved forest (&gt;5m)\n0.02\n\n\n110\nMosaic forest or shrubland (50-70%) / grassland (20-50%)\n0.015\n\n\n120\nMosaic grassland (50-70%) / forest or shrubland (20-50%)\n0.03\n\n\n130\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) (broadleaved or needleleaved, evergreen or deciduous) shrubland (&lt;5m)\n0.035\n\n\n140\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) herbaceous vegetation (grassland, savannas or lichens/mosses)\n0.05\n\n\n150\nSparse (&lt;15%) vegetation\n0.35\n\n\n160\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) broadleaved forest regularly flooded (semi-permanently or temporarily) - Fresh or brackish water\n0.001\n\n\n170\nClosed (&gt;40%) broadleaved forest or shrubland permanently flooded - Saline or brackish water\n0.0005\n\n\n180\nClosed to open (&gt;15%) grassland or woody vegetation on regularly flooded or waterlogged soil - Fresh, brackish or saline water\n0.04\n\n\n190\nArtificial surfaces and associated areas (Urban areas &gt;50%)\n0.0\n\n\n200\nBare areas\n0.0\n\n\n210\nWater bodies\n0.0\n\n\n220\nPermanent snow and ice\n0.0\n\n\n230\nNo data (burnt areas, clouds,…)\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\nOverland flow erosion\nOverland flow (or surface runoff) erosion is induced by the strength of the shear stress of the surface water on the soil. As in rainfall erosion, the effect of the flow shear stress can be reduced by the soil vegetation or by the soil properties. In wflow_sediment, soil detachment by overland flow is modelled as in ANSWERS with (Beasley et al, 1991):\n\\[\n   D_G = 0.90 \\, \\subtext{C}{USLE} \\, \\subtext{K}{USLE} \\, A_i \\, S \\, q\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\SIb{D_F}{kg\\ min^{-1}}\\) is soil detachment by flow, \\(\\subtext{C}{USLE}\\) and \\(\\subtext{K}{USLE}\\) are the USLE cover and soil erodibility factors, \\(\\SIb{A_i}{m^2}\\) is the cell area, \\(S\\) is the slope gradient and \\(\\SIb{q}{m^2\\ min^{-1}}\\) is the overland flow rate per unit width. The USLE \\(C\\) and \\(K\\) factors can be estimated with the same methods as for rainfall erosion and here the slope gradient is obtained from the sinus rather than the tangent of the slope angle.",

Topog_SBM is specifically designed to simulate fast runoff processes in small catchments while the wflow_sbm model can be applied more widely.\nTopog_SBM uses an element network based on contour lines and trajectories for water routing.

    "text": "wflow_sediment\nThe processes and fate of many particles and pollutants impacting water quality at the basin level are intricately linked to the processes governing sediment dynamics. Both nutrients such as phosphorus, carbon or other pollutants such as metals are influenced by sediment properties in processes such as mobilization, flocculation or deposition. To better assert and model water quality in inland systems, a better comprehension and modelling of sediment sources and fate in the river is needed at a spatial and time scale relevant to such issues.\nThe wflow_sediment model was developed to answer such issues. It is a distributed physics-based model, based on the distributed hydrologic wflow_sbm model. It is able to simulate both land and in-stream processes, and relies on available global datasets, parameter estimation and small calibration effort.\nIn order to model the exports of terrestrial sediment to the coast through the Land Ocean Aquatic Continuum or LOAC (inland waters network such as streams, lakes…), two different modelling parts were considered. The first part, called the inland sediment model, is the modelling and estimation of soil loss and sediment yield to the river system by land erosion, separated into vertical Soil Erosion processes and lateral Sediment Flux in overland flow. The second part, called the River Sediment Model is the transport and processes of the sediment in the river system. The two parts together constitute the wflow_sediment model.\nOverview of the concepts of the wflow_sediment model: \n\nConfiguration\nAs sediment generation and transport processes are linked to the hydrology and water flows, the inputs to the wflow_sediment model come directly from a hydrological model.

In addition, while the kinematic wave equations are solved with a nonlinear scheme using Newton’s method (Chow, 1988), other model equations are solved through a simple explicit scheme. In summary the following limitations apply:\n\nRiver flow, and to a lesser degree overland flow, may be unrealistic in terrain that is not steep, and where pressure forces and inertial momentum are important.\nThe lateral movement of subsurface flow may be very wrong in terrain that is not steep.",

    "text": "The forcing data (forcing.nc)\nThe forcing data typically contains the meteorological boundary conditions. This data is provided as a single netCDF file, with several variables containing the forcing data for precipitation, temperature and potential evaporation. The time unit of forcing data should be equal to the user-defined model time step size. The code snippet below shows the contents of the example file (downloaded here), and displaying the content with NCDatasets in Julia. As can be seen, each forcing variable (precip, pet and temp) consists of a three-dimensional dataset (x, y, and time), and each timestep consists of a two-dimensional map with values at each grid cell. Only values within the basin are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWflow expects the forcing to be “right-labelled”. This means that e.g. daily precipitation at 2023-06-15 00:00:00 is the accumulated total precipitation between 2023-06-14 00:00:00 and 2023-06-15 00:00:00.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor optimal computational performance, it is recommended to have chunks in the time dimension. This way, only part of the forcing file needs to be read and kept in memory. We recommend using a chunk size in the time dimension with size 1. Using larger chunks can largely degrade computational performance.\n\n\n\n\nClick to show example forcing.nc file\n\nGroup: /\n\nDimensions\n  time = 366\n  y = 313\n  x = 291\n\nVariables\n  time   (366)\n    Datatype:    Int64\n    Dimensions:  time\n    Attributes:\n    units                = days since 2000-01-02 00:00:00\n    calendar             = proleptic_gregorian\n\n  y   (313)\n    Datatype:    Float64\n    Dimensions:  y\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n\n  x   (291)\n    Datatype:    Float64\n    Dimensions:  x\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n\n  spatial_ref\n    Attributes:\n    crs_wkt              = GEOGCS[\"WGS 84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7030\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6326\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AXIS[\"Latitude\",NORTH],AXIS[\"Longitude\",EAST],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"]]\n    x_dim                = x\n    y_dim                = y\n    dim0                 = time\n\n  precip   (291 × 313 × 366)\n    Datatype:    Float32\n    Dimensions:  x × y × time\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n    unit                 = mm\n    precip_fn            = era5\n    coordinates          = idx_out spatial_ref mask\n\n  idx_out   (291 × 313)\n    Datatype:    Int32\n    Dimensions:  x × y\n\n  mask   (291 × 313)\n    Datatype:    UInt8\n    Dimensions:  x × y\n\n  pet   (291 × 313 × 366)\n    Datatype:    Float32\n    Dimensions:  x × y × time\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n    unit                 = mm\n    pet_fn               = era5\n    pet_method           = debruin\n    coordinates          = idx_out spatial_ref mask\n\n  temp   (291 × 313 × 366)\n    Datatype:    Float32\n    Dimensions:  x × y × time\n    Attributes:\n    _FillValue           = NaN\n    unit                 = degree C.\n    temp_fn              = era5\n    temp_correction      = True\n    coordinates          = idx_out spatial_ref mask\n\nGlobal attributes\n  unit                 = mm\n  precip_fn            = era5",
