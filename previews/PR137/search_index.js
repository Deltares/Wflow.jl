The first part, called the inland sediment model, is the modelling and estimation of soil loss and sediment yield to the river system by land erosion, separated into vertical Soil Erosion processes and lateral Sediment Flux in overland flow. The second part, called the River Sediment Model is the transport and processes of the sediment in the river system. The two parts together constitute the wflow_sediment model.","category":"page"},{"location":"model/sediment/","page":"wflow_sediment","title":"wflow_sediment","text":"Overview of the concepts of the wflow_sediment model: (Image: wflow_sediment)","category":"page"},{"location":"model/sediment/#Configuration","page":"wflow_sediment","title":"Configuration","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"model/sediment/","page":"wflow_sediment","title":"wflow_sediment","text":"As sediment generation and transport processes are linked to the hydrology and water flows, the inputs to the wflow_sediment model come directly from a hydrological model.

Sediments are transported in the river either by rolling, sliding and silting (bed load transport) or via turbulent flow in the higher water column (suspended load transport). The type of transport is determined by the river bed shear stress.
