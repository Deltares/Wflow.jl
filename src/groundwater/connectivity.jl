    Connectivity

Stores connection data between cells. Connections are stored in a compressed
sparse column (CSC) adjacency matrix: only non-zero values are stored.
Primarily, this consist of two vectors:
* the row value vector holds the cell indices of neighbors
* the column pointers marks the start and end index of the row value vector

This matrix is square: n = m = ncell. nconnection is equal to nnz (the number of
non-zero values).

* ncell: the number of (active) cells in the simulation
* nconnection: the number of connections between cells
* length1: for every connection, the length in the first cell, size nconnection
* length2: for every connection, the length in the second cell, size nconnection
* width: width for every connection, (approx.) perpendicular to length1 and
  length2, size nconnection
* colptr: CSC column pointer (size ncell + 1)
* rowval: CSC row value (size nconnection)
