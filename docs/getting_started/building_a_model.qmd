## HydroMT-wflow

[hydroMT](https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt) is a Python package, developed by Deltares, to
build and analyze hydro models. It provides a generic model api with attributes to access the
model schematization, (dynamic) forcing data, results and states.

The wflow plugin [hydroMT-wflow](https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow) of hydroMT can be
used to build and analyze the following model configurations:

- [wflow\_sbm + kinematic wave routing](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#kinematic-wave)
- [wflow\_sbm + local inertial river and floodplain](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#local-inertial-river)
- [wflow\_sbm + local inertial river (1D) and land (2D)](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#local-inertial-river-1d-and-land-2d)
- [wflow\_sediment](../model_docs/model_configurations.html#wflow_sediment)

To learn more about the wflow plugin of this Python package, we refer to the [hydroMT-wflow
documentation](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_wflow/latest/index.html).

To inspect or modify (for example in QGIS) the netCDF static data of these wflow models it is
convenient to export the maps to a raster format. This can be done as part of the hydroMT-wflow
plugin, see also the following
[example](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_wflow/latest/_examples/convert_staticmaps_to_mapstack.html).
It is also possible to create again the netCDF static data file based on the modified raster
map stack.


## Data requirements
The actual data requirements depend on the application of the Model and the Model type. Both
forcing and static data should be provided in netCDF format, with the same grid definition for
forcing and static data. The only exception is storage and rating curves for lakes, that should
be provided in CSV format, see also [Additional settings for
waterbodies](../model_docs/routing/waterbodies.qmd#additional-settings).

* Forcing data:
  - Precipitation
  - Potential evapotranspiration
  - Temperature (optional, only needed for snow and glacier modelling)

The requirements for static data (including model parameters) depend on the model type. The
following data is required for all model types, but not directly part of a model component:

+ flow direction data (D8)
+ river map (location of the river)
+ sub-catchment map (model domain)

For the flow direction (D8) data, the PCRaster `ldd` convention is used, see also [PCRaster
ldd](https://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/pcraster/4.3.1/documentation/pcraster_manual/sphinx/secdatbase.html#ldd-data-type).
An approach to generate `ldd` data is to make use of the Python package
[pyflwdir](https://github.com/Deltares/pyflwdir):

+ to [upscale existing flow direction
  data](https://deltares.github.io/pyflwdir/latest/_examples/upscaling.html) as the 3 arcsec
  MERIT Hydro data (Yamazaki et al., 2019)
+ or to [derive flow directions from elevation
  data](https://deltares.github.io/pyflwdir/latest/_examples/from_dem.html),

see also Eilander et al. (2021) for more information. Pyflwdir is also used by the
[hydroMT](https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt) Python package described in the next paragraph.
Another approach to generate `ldd` data is to make use of PCRaster functionality, see for
example
[lddcreate](https://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/pcraster/4.3.1/documentation/pcraster_manual/sphinx/op_lddcreate.html).

Optionally, but also not directly part of a model component are `gauge` locations, that are
used to extract gridded data from certain locations, and `lake` and `reservoir` locations
and areas (coverage).

The different supported model configurations are described in the section [Model
configurations](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd). Wflow\_sbm models have the [Land
Hydrology SBM](../model_docs/land/landhydrology_sbm.qmd) model in common and input
parameters for this model are described in the list of [parameters and
variables](../model_docs/parameters_landhydrology_sbm.qmd) of this model. For wflow\_sbm
models there are two ways to include subsurface flow:

1. The kinematic wave approach (see section [Subsurface flow
   routing](../model_docs/routing/kinwave.qmd#subsurface-flow-routing)) as part of the `sbm`
   model type. Parameters that are part of this component are described in the [Lateral
   subsurface flow](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#lateral-subsurface-flow) section.
   Input parameters for this component are derived from the soil model of the Land Hydrology
   SBM model (`soil__thickness` [mm], `soil_water__saturated_volume_fraction` [-] and
   `soil_water__residual_volume_fraction` [-]) and the land slope `land_surface__slope`
   input parameter. The parameter
   `subsurface_water__horizontal-to-vertical_saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_ratio` [-] is
   used to calculate the horizontal hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface `kh_0`.
2. Groundwater flow (see section [Groundwater flow
   component](../model_docs/routing/gwf.qmd)) as part of the `sbm_gwf` model type. For the
   unconfined aquifer the input parameters are described in the section [Unconfined
   aquifer](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#unconfined-aquifer). The bottom (`bottom`)
   of the groundwater layer is derived from the provided `soil__thickness` [mm] and surface
   elevation `land_surface__elevation` [m] parameters as part of the static input. The
   `area` parameter is derived from the model grid. Parameters that are part of the boundary
   conditions of the unconfined aquifer are listed under [Constant
   Head](../model_docs/routing/gwf.qmd#head-boundary) and [Boundary
   conditions](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#river-boundary) sections.

The default wflow\_sbm model routing configuration makes use of the kinematic wave surface
routing (river flow, overland flow or both) and input data required for the river and
overland flow components is described in [Surface
flow](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#surface-flow). There is also the option to use
the local inertial model as part of the wflow\_sbm models (model types `sbm` and `sbm_gwf`):

+ for river flow, see also the [Local inertial river and
  floodplain](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#sbm-local-inertial-river) model.
+ for 1D river flow and 2D overland flow combined, see also the [Local inertial river (1D) and
  land (2D)](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#sbm-local-inertial-river-1d-and-land-2d)
  model.

Input parameters for this approach are listed under [River flow (local
inertial)](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#local-inertial), including the optional 1D
[floodplain schematization](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#d-floodplain-flow), and
[Overland flow (local inertial)](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#overland-flow)
sections.

Reservoirs or lakes can be part of the kinematic wave or local inertial model for river flow
and input parameters are listed under the
[Reservoirs](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#reservoirs) and
[Lakes](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#lakes) sections.

The [wflow\_sediment](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#wflow_sediment) model
configuration consists of the [Soil Erosion](../model_docs/land/sediment.qmd) concept and
the input parameters for this concept are listed under the
[Sediment](../model_docs/parameters_sediment.qmd) section. The parameters of the
routing [Sediment Flux in overland
flow](../model_docs/routing/sediment_flux.qmd#sediment-flux-in-overland-flow) concept are
listed under the [Overland flow](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#overland-flow-1)
section. The input parameters of the routing concept [River Sediment
Model](../model_docs/routing/sediment_flux.qmd#river-sediment-model) are listed under the
[River flow](../model_docs/parameters_routing.qmd#river-flow-1) section.

Example models can be found in the [Example models section](./download_example_models.qmd).
