## HydroMT-wflow

[hydroMT](https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt) is a Python package, developed by Deltares, to
build and analyze hydro models. It provides a generic model api with attributes to access the
model schematization, (dynamic) forcing data, results and states.

The wflow plugin [hydroMT-wflow](https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow) of hydroMT can be
used to build and analyze the following model configurations:

- [wflow\_sbm + kinematic wave routing](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#sbm-kinematic-wave)
- [wflow\_sbm + local inertial river and floodplain](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#sbm-local-inertial-river)
- [wflow\_sbm + local inertial river (1D) and land (2D)](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#sbm-local-inertial-river-1d-and-land-2d)
- [wflow\_sediment](../model_docs/model_configurations.html#wflow_sediment)

To learn more about the wflow plugin of this Python package, we refer to the [hydroMT-wflow
documentation](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_wflow/latest/index.html).

To inspect or modify (for example in QGIS) the netCDF static data of these wflow models it is
convenient to export the maps to a raster format. This can be done as part of the hydroMT-wflow
plugin, see also the following
[example](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_wflow/latest/_examples/convert_staticmaps_to_mapstack.html).
It is also possible to create again the netCDF static data file based on the modified raster
map stack.


## Data requirements
The actual data requirements depend on the application of the Model and the Model type. Both
forcing and static data should be provided in netCDF format, with the same grid definition for
forcing and static data. The only exception is storage and rating curves for lakes, that should
be provided in CSV format, see also [Additional settings for
waterbodies](../model_docs/lateral/waterbodies.qmd#additional-settings).

* Forcing data:
  - Precipitation
  - Potential evapotranspiration
  - Temperature (optional, only needed for snow and glacier modelling)

The requirements for static data (including model parameters) depend on the Model type. The
following data is required for all Model types, but not directly part of a Model component:

+ flow direction data (D8)
+ river map (location of the river)
+ sub-catchment map (model domain)

For the flow direction (D8) data, the PCRaster `ldd` convention is used, see also [PCRaster
ldd](https://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/pcraster/4.3.1/documentation/pcraster_manual/sphinx/secdatbase.html#ldd-data-type).
An approach to generate `ldd` data is to make use of the Python package
[pyflwdir](https://github.com/Deltares/pyflwdir):

+ to [upscale existing flow direction
  data](https://deltares.github.io/pyflwdir/latest/_examples/upscaling.html) as the 3 arcsec
  MERIT Hydro data (Yamazaki et al., 2019)
+ or to [derive flow directions from elevation
  data](https://deltares.github.io/pyflwdir/latest/_examples/from_dem.html),

see also Eilander et al. (2021) for more information. Pyflwdir is also used by the
[hydroMT](https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt) Python package described in the next paragraph.
Another approach to generate `ldd` data is to make use of PCRaster functionality, see for
example
[lddcreate](https://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/pcraster/4.3.1/documentation/pcraster_manual/sphinx/op_lddcreate.html).

Optionally, but also not directly part of a model component are `gauge` locations, that are
used to extract gridded data from certain locations.

The different supported model configurations are described in the section [Model
configurations](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd). Wflow\_sbm models have the vertical
concept [SBM](../model_docs/vertical/sbm.qmd) in common and input parameters for this component
are described in the [SBM model parameters table](../model_docs/parameters_vertical.qmd#sbm).
For wflow\_sbm models there are two ways to include subsurface flow:

1. The kinematic wave approach (see section [Subsurface flow
   routing](../model_docs/lateral/kinwave.qmd#subsurface-flow-routing)) as part of the `sbm`
   model type. Parameters that are part of this component are described in the [Lateral
   subsurface flow](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#lateral-subsurface-flow) section of
   Model parameters. Input parameters for this component are derived from the SBM vertical
   concept and the land slope. One external parameter (`ksathorfrac`) is used to calculate the
   horizontal hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface `kh_0`.
2. Groundwater flow (see section [Groundwater flow component](../model_docs/lateral/gwf.qmd))
   as part of the `sbm_gwf` model type. For the unconfined aquifer the input parameters are
   described in the section [Unconfined
   aquifer](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#unconfined-aquifer) of Model parameters. The
   bottom (`bottom`) of the groundwater layer is derived from from the `soilthickness` [mm]
   parameter of `SBM` and the provided surface elevation `altitude` [m] as part of the static
   input. The `area` parameter is derived from the model grid. Parameters that are part of the
   boundary conditions of the unconfined aquifer are listed under [Constant
   Head](../model_docs/lateral/gwf.qmd#head-boundary) and [Boundary
   conditions](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#boundary-conditions) of the Model
   parameters section.

Most hydrological model configurations make use of the kinematic wave surface routing (river
flow, overland flow or both) and input data required for the river and overland flow components
is described in [Surface flow](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#surface-flow). There is
also the option to use the local inertial model as part of the wflow\_sbm models (model types
`sbm` and `sbm_gwf`):

+ for river flow, see also the [Local inertial river and
  floodplain](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#sbm-local-inertial-river) model.
+ for 1D river flow and 2D overland flow combined, see also the [Local inertial river (1D) and
  land (2D)](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#sbm-local-inertial-river-1d-and-land-2d)
  model.

Input parameters for this approach are described in [River flow (local
inertial)](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#local-inertial), including the optional 1D
[floodplain schematization](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#d-floodplain), and [Overland
flow (local inertial)](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#overland-flow) of the Model
parameters section.

Reservoirs or lakes can be part of the kinematic wave or local inertial model for river flow
and input parameters are described in
[Reservoirs](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#reservoirs) and
[Lakes](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#lakes).

The [wflow\_sediment](../model_docs/model_configurations.qmd#wflow_sediment) model
configuration consists of the vertical [Soil Erosion](../model_docs/vertical/sediment.qmd)
concept and the input parameters for this concept are described in the
[Sediment](../model_docs/parameters_vertical.qmd#sediment) section of the Model parameters. The
parameters of the lateral [Sediment Flux in overland
flow](../model_docs/lateral/sediment_flux.qmd#sediment-flux-in-overland-flow) concept are
described in the [Overland flow](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#overland-flow-1) section
of the Model parameters. Parameters of this component are not directly set by data from static
input. The input parameters of the lateral concept [River Sediment
Model](../model_docs/lateral/sediment_flux.qmd#river-sediment-model) are listed in [River
flow](../model_docs/parameters_lateral.qmd#river-flow-1) of the Model parameters section.

The Model parameters section lists all the parameters per Model component and these Tables can
also be used to check which parameters can be part of the output, see also [Output netCDF
section](../user_guide/toml_file.qmd#output-netcdf-section) and [Output CSV
section](../user_guide/toml_file.qmd#output-csv-section).

Example models can be found in the [Example models section](./download_example_models.qmd).
