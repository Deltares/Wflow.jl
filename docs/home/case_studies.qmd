## Wflow models for the Meuse and Rhine

Reliable hydrological models for the Rhine and the Meuse river basins are necessary for
short-term forecasting of river flows and long-term predictions for strategic water management
planning. In collaboration with Rijkswaterstaat, Deltares is developing a new line of models
for the Rhine and the Meuse basins. The models will be used for forecasting and to estimate the
impact of climate change on water resources and extreme streamflow. In the model development,
we aim to improve hydrological predictions by including relevant processes in the model
schematization. The modularity of the wflow framework is ideal for this as we can easily
evaluate the combination of different vertical and lateral model components. For example, the
local inertial routing for river and overland flow enables us to consider retention of water in
the floodplains, which is likely to improve extreme streamflow predictions.

## Operational flood forecasting in Australia

In Australia, there was a need for high-resolution, fast and accurate rainfall-runoff models to
provide boundary conditions for a fast and detailed flood inundation model (SFINCS). The domain
of the flood model covers the entire North and East Coast of Australia. Although many gauging
stations are available to provide real-time information, many rivers are not covered. For these
locations, wflow\_sbm models are used to provide this real-time information. Additionally,
these models are used to provide projections for potential future scenarios. Using the HydroMT
library, all wflow\_sbm models were automatically built. The high level of flexibility in
spatial and temporal resolution, combined with the physics-based nature of the concept, makes
Wflow\_sbm particularly suitable for ungauged basins. Furthermore, the model is detailed and
computationally efficient enough for coupling with the fast flood inundation model SFINCS.

The results of this proof of concept are very promising. Technically, we were able to quickly
set up the wflow\_sbm models, couple them to the flood inundation models (SFINCS), and run the
models operationally under the Delft-FEWS platform. Model validation was conducted for two
basins by comparing the results of Wflow\_sbm against observations and the results of
calibrated URBS models. This validation demonstrated that the uncalibrated Wflow\_sbm model
results were already quite satisfactory, especially given the complex nature of these basins,
which include several small and large reservoirs. We could also show the potential for further
calibration by adjusting the KsatHorFrac parameter.

## Simulating plastic transport in Thailand

For the Pollution Control Board of the Government of Thailand and the World Bank, we supported
a material flow analysis of plastics in Thailand using wflow. Plastic pollution is a growing
global issue. Plastic waste enters rivers and is transported to the ocean where it persists and
threatens the health of the ocean, seas and coasts. The initial movement of plastic waste is in
many cases triggered by runoff from (heavy) rainfall and transported by water flow towards
small streams and rivers. Therefore there is strong relation to rainfall-runoff processes,
which can be modeled using high-resolution rainfall-runoff models.

In this study we applied the wflow\_sbm model in combination with a fate-and-transport and
water quality model (DelWaq) to simulate the movement of plastics through five large river
basins and on three island and coastal zones (Krabi, Phuket, and Ko Samui; see screenshot of
the model below) in Thailand. Together with our partners Panya Consultants and HII, we were
able to identify hotspots of plastic pollution, estimate how much plastic waste would end up in
the Gulf of Thailand and recommend priority areas for reducing plastic waste reaching the sea.

The wflow\_sbm models for the five large basins were calibrated. The presence of large dams and
reservoirs complicated calibration, but with the input for the dam operation, the model
performance for these basins could be largely improved. The figure below shows the calibrated
model results for the Chao Phraya, just upstream of Bangkok. The input from the hydrological
wflow\_sbm model was used as input for the fate and transport model to assess the amount of
plastic transported to the ocean.
