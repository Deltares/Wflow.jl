title: Model structure

Below the Julia composite type that represents all different aspects of a `Wflow.Model`,
such as the domain and shared parameters, routing concepts, land model, clock, model type,
configuration and input and output.

```julia
struct Model{R <: Routing, L <: AbstractLandModel, T <: AbstractModelType} <:
       AbstractModel{T}
    config::Config                  # all configuration options
    domain::Domain                  # domain connectivity (network) and shared parameters
    routing::R                      # routing model (horizontal fluxes), moves along network
    land::L                         # land model simulating vertical fluxes, independent of each other
    clock::Clock                    # to keep track of simulation time
    reader::NCReader                # provides the model with dynamic input
    writer::Writer                  # writes model output
    type::T                         # model type
end
```

The `domain` field represents network (including connectivity) information of different
modelling domains as the `river`, `land`, or `subsurface` domain and it contains shared
model parameters that can be used across different model components. The `routing` field of
the `struct Model` can contain different routing concepts for river, land and subsurface
flow domains. For example, the wflow\_sbm model with default configuration contains the
kinematic wave routing concept for river, overland and lateral subsurface flow. The `land`
field of the `struct Model` represents a land model, simulating vertical fluxes, for example
soil erosion as part of the `sediment` model type and snow melt as part of the `sbm` model
type.
