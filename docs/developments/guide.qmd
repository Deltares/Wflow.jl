## Contributions and reporting issues

We welcome reporting of issues on [our GitHub
page](https://github.com/Deltares/Wflow.jl/issues/new/choose). Please provide a minimum working
example so we are able to reproduce the issue. Furthermore, we welcome contributions. We follow
the [ColPrac guide for collaborative practices](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac). New
contributors should make sure to read that guide.

To get started with local development, install Julia and pre-commit by running the command below.

```sh
pixi run install
```

## Style/decisions

- For improved code readability, we decided to avoid non-ASCII characters for naming variables,
  structs, functions and macros. Using the non-ASCII character for built-in operators is still
  allowed. This change in naming convention is now in effect and all invalid uses of non-ASCII
  characters have been replaced by ASCII equivalents.
