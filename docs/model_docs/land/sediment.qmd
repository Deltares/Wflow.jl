---

Over the land, soil erosion, also called soil loss, is closely linked to the water cycle.
The main processes governing sediment generation are splash erosion from rain droplets, and
sheet and rill erosion from the shear stress caused by overland flow. The intensity of soil
erosion by rain or ﬂow depends on the land and soil characteristics such as slope, land use
or soil type. Once soil is eroded, the detached particles can be transported downslope by
overland ﬂow. Along the transport pathways, soil particles can also be deposited due to a
low flow velocity, a change of topography in depressions, footslopes or valley bottoms,
and/or can be filtered and stopped by a change in vegetation such as ﬁeld boundaries.

The inland part of the sediment gathers these different processes, separated in a structure
for the soil loss and routing structure for the transport in overland flow.

## Soil Erosion
The first process to consider in sediment dynamics is the generation of sediments by land
erosion. The main processes behind soil loss are rainfall erosion and overland flow erosion.
In order to model such processes at a fine time and space scale, physics-based models such
as ANSWERS and EUROSEM were chosen here.

The choice of rainfall erosion model is set up in the model section of the TOML:
```toml
[model]
rainfall_erosion = "answers" # Rainfall erosion model: ["answers", "eurosem"]
```

### Rainfall erosion
In wflow\_sediment, rainfall erosion can both be modelled using EUROSEM or ANSWERS equation.
The main difference between the models is that EUROSEM uses a more physics-based approach
based on the kinetic energy of the rain drops impacting the soil (Morgan et al, 1998), while
ANSWERS is more empirical and uses parameters from the USLE model (Beasley et al, 1991).

In EUROSEM, rainfall erosion is modelled according to rainfall intensity and its kinetic
energy when it reaches the soil according to equations developed by Brandt (1990). As the
intensity of the rain kinetic energy depends on the length of the fall, rainfall intercepted
by vegetation will then be reduced compared to direct throughfall. The kinetic energy of
direct throughfall is estimated by (Morgan et al, 1998):
$$
   \subtext{\mathrm{KE}}{direct} = 8.95 + 8.44\,\log_{10}(R_i)
$$

where $\SIb{\subtext{\mathrm{KE}}{direct}}{J\ m^{-2}\ mm^{-1}}$ is the kinetic energy of
direct throughfall and $\SIb{R_i}{mm\ h^{-1}}$ is rainfall intensity. If the rainfall is
intercepted by vegetation and falls as leaf drainage, its kinetic energy is then reduced
according to (Brandt, 1990):
$$
   \subtext{\mathrm{KE}}{leaf} = 15.8\,\sqrt{H_p} - 5.87
$$
where $\SIb{\subtext{\mathrm{KE}}{leaf}}{J\ m^{-2}\ mm^{-1}}$ is kinetic energy of leaf
drainage and $\SIb{H_p}{m}$ is the effective canopy height (half of plant height). Canopy
height can be derived from the global map from Simard & al. (2011) or by user input
depending on the land use.

Kinetic energies from both direct throughfall and leaf drainage are then multiplied by the
respective depths of direct throughfall and leaf drainage (mm) and added to get the total
rainfall kinetic energy $\mathrm{KE}$. The soil detached by rainfall $\SIb{D_R}{g\ m^{-2}}$
is then:
$$
   D_R = k\,\mathrm{KE}\,e^{-\varphi h}
$$
where $\SIb{k}{g\ J^{-1}}$ is an index of the detachability of the soil, 
$\SIb{\mathrm{KE}}{J\ m^{-2}}$ is the total rainfall kinetic energy, $\SIb{h}{m}$ is the
surface runoff depth on the soil and $\varphi$ is an exponent varying between $0.9$ and
$3.1$ used to reduce rainfall impact if the soil is already covered by water. As a
simplification, Torri (1987) has shown that a value of $2.0$ for $\varphi$ is representative
enough for a wide range of soil conditions. The detachability of the soil $k$ depends on the
soil texture (proportion of clay, silt and sand content) and corresponding values are
defined in EUROSEM user guide (Morgan et al, 1998). As a simplification, in
`wflow_sediment`, the mean value of the detachability shown in the table below are used.
Soil texture can for example be derived from the topsoil clay and silt content from
SoilGrids (Hengl et al, 2017).

Table: Mean detachability of soil depending on its texture (Morgan et al, 1998).

| Texture (USDA system) | Mean detachability $\SIb{k}{g\ J^{-1}}$ |
|:--------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Clay | 2.0 |
| Clay Loam | 1.7 |
| Silt | 1.2 |
| Silt Loam | 1.5 |
| Loam | 2.0 |
| Sandy Loam | 2.6 |
| Loamy Sand | 3.0 |
| Fine Sand | 3.5 |
| Sand | 1.9 |

Rainfall erosion is handled differently in ANSWERS. There, the impacts of vegetation and
soil properties are handled through the USLE coefficients in the equation (Beasley et al,
1991):

$$
   D_R = 0.108 \, \subtext{C}{USLE} \, \subtext{K}{USLE} \, A_i \, R_i^2
$$

where $\SIb{D_R}{kg\ min^{-1}}$ is the soil detachment by rainfall, $\subtext{C}{USLE}$ is
the soil cover-management factor from the USLE equation, $\subtext{K}{USLE}$ is the soil
erodibility factor from the USLE equation, $\SIb{A_i}{m^2}$ is the area of the cell and
$\SIb{R_i}{mm\ min^{-1}}$ is the rainfall intensity. There are several methods available to
estimate the $C$ and $K$ factors from the USLE. They can come from user input maps, for
example maps resulting from Panagos & al.'s recent studies for Europe (Panagos et al, 2015)
(Ballabio et al, 2016). To get an estimate of the $C$ factor globally, the other method is
to estimate $C$ values for the different land use type in from global land cover maps (e.g.
GlobCover). An example is given for the global land cover map GlobCover, summed up in the
table below, the values come from a literature study including Panagos et al.'s review
(2015), Gericke & al. (2015), Mansoor & al. (2013), Chadli et al. (2016), de Vente et al.
(2009), Borrelli et al. (2014), Yang et al. (2003) and Bosco et al. (2015).

The other methods to estimate the USLE $K$ factor are to use either topsoil composition or
topsoil geometric mean diameter. $K$ estimation from topsoil composition is estimated with
the equation developed in the EPIC model (Williams et al, 1983):

$$
\begin{gathered}
   \subtext{K}{USLE} = \left[ 0.2 + 0.3\exp\left(-0.0256\;\mathrm{SAN}\frac{(1-\mathrm{SIL})}{100}\right) \right]
   \left(\frac{\mathrm{SIL}}{\mathrm{CLA}+\mathrm{SIL}}\right)^{0.3} \\
   \left(1-\frac{0.25\;\mathrm{OC}}{\mathrm{OC}+e^{3.72-2.95\;\mathrm{OC}}}\right)\left(1-\frac{0.75\;\mathrm{SN}}{\mathrm{SN}+e^{-5.51+22.9\;\mathrm{SN}}}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

where $\SIb{\mathrm{CLA}}{\%}$, $\SIb{\mathrm{SIL}}{\%}$, $\SIb{\mathrm{SAN}}{\%}$ are
respectively the clay, silt and sand fractions of the topsoil, $\SIb{OC}{\%}$ is the topsoil
organic carbon content and $\mathrm{SN} = 1-\mathrm{SAN}/100$. These soil parameters can be
derived for example from the SoilGrids dataset. The $K$ factor can also be estimated from
the soil mean geometric diameter using the formulation from the RUSLE guide by Renard & al.
(1997):

$$
   \subtext{K}{USLE} = 0.0034 + 0.0405\exp\left(-\dfrac{1}{2}\left(\dfrac{\log_{10}(D_g)+1.659}{0.7101}\right)^2\right)
$$

where $D_g$ is the soil geometric mean diameter (mm) estimated from topsoil clay, silt, sand
fraction.

### Overland flow erosion

Overland flow (or surface runoff) erosion is induced by the strength of the shear stress of
the surface water on the soil. As in rainfall erosion, the effect of the flow shear stress
can be reduced by the soil vegetation or by the soil properties. In wflow_sediment, soil
detachment by overland flow is modelled as in ANSWERS with (Beasley et al, 1991):

$$
   D_G = 0.90 \, \subtext{C}{USLE} \, \subtext{K}{USLE} \, A_i \, S \, q
$$

where $\SIb{D_F}{kg\ min^{-1}}$ is soil detachment by flow, $\subtext{C}{USLE}$ and
$\subtext{K}{USLE}$ are the USLE cover and soil erodibility factors, $\SIb{A_i}{m^2}$ is the
cell area, $S$ is the slope gradient and $\SIb{q}{m^2\ min^{-1}}$ is the overland flow rate
per unit width. The USLE $C$ and $K$ factors can be estimated with the same methods as for
rainfall erosion and here the slope gradient is obtained from the sinus rather than the
tangent of the slope angle.

## Delivery to the river system
Once soil is detached, it can be transported by overland flow and reach the river system.
This process is described in [Sediment Flux in overland
flow](../routing/sediment_flux.qmd#sediment-flux-in-overland-flow).
