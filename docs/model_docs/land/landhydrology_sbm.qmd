## Introduction
The Land Hydrology `SBM` model is largely based on Topog_SBM (Vertessy and Elsenbeer, 1999),
which considers the soil to be a “bucket” with a saturated and unsaturated store. The main
differences between the Land Hydrology `SBM` model and Topog_SBM are as follows:

- the addition of evapotranspiration and interception losses;
- the addition of a root water uptake reduction function (Feddes et al., 1978);
- the addition of a capillary rise;
- the addition of glacier, snow build-up and melting processes;
- the addition to divide the soil column into different layers to allow for transfer of
  water within the unsaturated zone;
- the addition of water demand and allocation computations.

The Land Hydrology `SBM` model contains besides a `SBM` `soil` model (including
evapotranspiration), models for `interception`, `snow`, `glacier` , water `demand` and
`allocation`. The sections below describe the working of the Land Hydrology `SBM` model in
more detail.

## Rainfall interception
Two different interception models are available: the Gash model, and the modified Rutter
model. The simulation timestep defines which interception model is used, where daily (or
larger) timesteps use the Gash model, and timesteps smaller than daily use the modified
Rutter model.

### The Gash model
The Gash interception model (Gash, 1979) can to be applied on a daily basis, although a
storm-based approach will yield better results in situations with more than one storm per
day. The amount of water needed to completely saturate the canopy is defined as:

$$
    P'=\frac{-\overline{R}S}{\overline{E}_{w}}\log\left[1-\frac{\overline{E}_{w}}{\overline{R}}(1-p-p_{t})^{-1}\right],
$$

where $\overline{R}$ is the average precipitation intensity on a saturated canopy and
$\overline{E}_{w}$ the average evaporation from the wet canopy and with the vegetation
parameters $S$, $p$ and $p_t$ as defined previously. The model uses a series of expressions
to calculate the interception loss during different phases of a storm. An analytical
integration of the total evaporation and rainfall under saturated canopy conditions is
performed for each storm to determine average values of $\overline{E}_{w}$ and
$\overline{R}$. The total evaporation from the canopy (the total interception loss) is
calculated as the sum of the components listed in the table below. Interception losses from
the stems are calculated for days with $P\geq S_{t}/p_{t}$. $p_t$ and $S_t$ are small and
neglected.

Table: Formulation of the components of interception loss according to Gash:

| Components  | Interception loss |
| -------- | ---- |
| For $m$ small storms ($P_{g}<{P'}_{g}$)    | $(1-p-p_{t})\sum_{j=1}^{m}P_{g,j}$ |
| Wetting up the canopy in $n$ large storms ($P_{g}\geq{P'}_{g}$)     | $n(1-p-p_{t}){P'}_{g}-nS$ |
| Evaporation from saturated canopy during rainfall | $\overline{E}/\overline{R}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(P_{g,j}-{P'}_{g})$|
| Evaporation after rainfall ceases for $n$ large storms | $nS$ |
| Evaporation from trunks in $q$ storms that fill the trunk storage | $qS_{t}$ |
| Evaporation from  trunks in $m+n-q$ storms that do not fill the trunk storage | $p_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{m+n-q}P_{g,j}$ |

Saturated conditions are assumed to occur when the hourly rainfall exceeds a certain
threshold. Often a threshold of $\SI{0.5}{mm\ h^{-1}}$ is used. $\overline{R}$ is calculated
for all hours when the rainfall exceeds the threshold to give an estimate of the mean
rainfall rate onto a saturated canopy.

Gash (1979) has shown that in a regression of interception loss on rainfall (on a storm
basis) the regression coefficient should equal to $\overline{E}_w/\overline{R}$. Assuming
that neither $\overline{E}_w$ nor $\overline{R}$ vary considerably in time, $\overline{E}_w$
can be estimated in this way from $\overline{R}$ in the absence of above-canopy climatic
observations. Values derived in this way generally tend to be (much) higher than those
calculated with the penman-monteith equation.

### The modified rutter model
For sub daily timesteps the interception is calculated using a simplification of the Rutter
model. The simplified model is solved explicitly and does not take drainage from the canopy
into account. The stemflow fraction is defined as a fixed fraction (0.1) of canopy gap
fraction $\SIb{f_\mathrm{canopygap}}{-}$ limited by the canopy fraction
$(1-f_\mathrm{canopygap})$ and the amount of stemflow is taken as the stemflow fraction of
precipitation. Throughfall equals to the amount of water that cannot be stored by the
canopy, plus the rainfall that is not captured by the canopy. Water can evaporate from the
canopy storage, taken as the minimum between potential evaporation and the current storage.
The "left-over" potential evaporation (if any) is returned as output.

### Interception parameters from LAI
The SBM concept can determine the interception parameters from leaf area index
($\SIb{\mathrm{LAI}}{m^2 m^{-2}}$) climatology. In order to switch this on you must define
this cyclic parameter in the TOML file, the parameter is read from `path_static`, as
follows:

```toml
[input]
path_forcing = "forcing-moselle.nc"
path_static = "staticmaps-moselle.nc"

[input.cyclic]
vegetation__leaf_area_index = "LAI"
```
Furthermore, these additional parameters are required:

+ Specific leaf storage ($\SIb{S_\mathrm{leaf}}{mm}$)
+ Storage woody part of vegetation ($\SIb{S_\mathrm{wood, max}}{mm}$)
+ Extinction coefficient ($\SIb{k}{-}$)

Here it is assumed that the canopy storage capacity for the leaves
$\SIb{S_\mathrm{leaf, max}}{mm}$ relates linearly with $\mathrm{LAI}$ (c.f. Van Dijk and
Bruijnzeel 2001). This is done via the specific leaf storage $S_\mathrm{leaf}$, a parameter
that can be determined through a lookup table with land cover based on literature (Pitman
1989, Lui 1998). Next $S_\mathrm{leaf, max}$ is determined using:

$$
    S_\mathrm{leaf, max}  = S_\mathrm{leaf}\ \mathrm{LAI}.
$$

To get to total storage $\SIb{S_\mathrm{canopy, max}}{mm}$ the woody part of the vegetation
also needs to be added. As for $S_\mathrm{leaf}$, the storage of the woody part
$S_\mathrm{wood, max}$ can also be related to land cover (lookup table).

The canopy gap fraction $\SIb{f_\mathrm{canopygap}}{-}$ is determined using the extinction
coefficient $k$ (van Dijk and Bruijnzeel 2001):

$$
    f_\mathrm{canopygap} = \exp(-k\ \mathrm{LAI}).
$$

The extinction coefficient $k$ can be related to land cover.

## Snow and glaciers

Both options can be enabled by specifying the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
snow__flag = true
glacier__flag = true
```

### Snow modelling
Snow processes are adopted from the HBV-96 hydrological model concept (Bergström, 1992). If
the air temperature, $T_\mathrm{air}$, is below a user-defined threshold
$s_\mathrm{fall, T threshold}$ $\SIb{}{\degree C}$ effective precipitation (throughfall and
stemflow) occurs as snowfall, whereas it occurs as rainfall if
$T_\mathrm{air} ≥ s_\mathrm{fall, T threshold}$. Another parameter $s_\mathrm{fall, T interval}$
$\SIb{}{\degree C}$ defines how precipitation can occur partly as rain or snowfall.

If precipitation occurs as snowfall, it is added to the dry snow component within the snow
pack. Otherwise it ends up in the free water reservoir, which represents the liquid water
content of the snow pack. Between the two components of the snow pack, interactions take
place, either through snow melt (if temperatures are above a threshold
$\SIb{s_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}}{\degree C}$) or through snow refreezing (if temperatures
are below threshold $s_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}$).

The potential snowmelt rate $\SIb{M_\mathrm{snow, pot}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$, using the degree-day
factor $\SIb{s_\mathrm{ddf}}{mm\ \degree C^{-1}\ t^{-1}}$, is calculated as follows:

$$
  M_\mathrm{snow, pot}=\begin{cases}
    s_\mathrm{ddf} (T_\mathrm{air}-s_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}) & \text{if $T_\mathrm{air}>s_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}$}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
$$

The actual snowmelt rate is limited by the snow storage.

The snowpack retains water that can refreeze if $T^{t}_\mathrm{air}$ is below
$s_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}$. The potential refreezing rate
$\SIb{M_\mathrm{refreeze, pot}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$, is controlled by $s_\mathrm{ddf}$, a
coefficient of refreezing $\SIb{s_\mathrm{refreeze}}{-}$ (fixed: 0.05), $T^{t}_\mathrm{air}$
and $s_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}$ as follows:

$$
M_\mathrm{refreeze, pot}=\begin{cases}
    s_\mathrm{ddf} s_\mathrm{refreeze} (s_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}-T^{t}_\mathrm{air}) & \text{if $T^{t}_\mathrm{air}<s_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}$}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
$$

The actual refreezing rate is limited by the liquid water content of snow.

The fraction of liquid water in the snow pack is at most equal to a user defined fraction,
$\SIb{s_\mathrm{whc}}{-}$, of the water equivalent of the dry snow content
$\SIb{\subtext{S}{snow}}{mm}$. If the liquid water content exceeds $s_\mathrm{whc}$, either
through snow melt or incoming effective precipitation, snow runoff
$\SIb{\subtext{R}{snow}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$ becomes available for infiltration into the soil:

$$
\subtext{R}{snow} = \mathrm{max}(S_\mathrm{snow, liquid} - S_\mathrm{snow} s_\mathrm{whc}, 0).

### Glacier modelling

Glacier processes can be modelled if the snow model is enabled. Glacier modelling is very
similar to snow modelling and considers two main processes: glacier build-up from snow turning
into firn/ice (using the HBV-light model) and glacier melt (using a temperature degree-day
model).

The definition of glacier boundaries and initial volume is defined by two parameters. The
parameter $\SIb{\subtext{f}{glacier}}{-}$ gives the fraction of each grid cell covered by a
glacier as a number between zero and one. The state parameter glacier store
$\SIb{\subtext{S}{glacier}}{mm}$ gives the amount of water (water equivalent) within the
glaciers at each grid cell. A map with $\subtext{S}{glacier}$ values can be provided as an
initial state (default: $\SI{5500}{mm}$) when the model is initialized with default values
in the code (“cold” start). The required glacier data can be prepared from available glacier
datasets.

First, a fixed fraction $\SIb{\subtext{g}{snow\ to\ ice}}{t^{-1}}$, that typically ranges
between $0.001$ and $0.006$ for a daily time step, of snow storage
$\SIb{S_\mathrm{snow}}{mm}$ on top of the glacier is converted into ice for each time step
$t$ of length $\Delta{t}$ [s]:

$$
S_\mathrm{snow\ to\ ice} = \mathrm{min}(g_\mathrm{snow\ to\ ice} S_\mathrm{snow}, 8 \frac{\Delta{t}}{\Delta{t_b}}),
$$

where $\SIb{S_\mathrm{snow\ to\ ice}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$ is the snow into ice conversion rate,
with a maximum conversion rate of $\SI{8}{mm\ d^{-1}}$. This maximum conversion rate is
scaled by $\Delta{t}$, and the model base time step size $\Delta{t_b}$ of $\SIb{86,400}{s}$.

The snow storage from the snow module $\SIb{\subtext{S}{snow}}{mm}$ is then updated as follows:

$$
S_\mathrm{snow} = S_\mathrm{snow} - S_\mathrm{snow\ to\ ice}  f_\mathrm{glacier}.
$$

When the snowpack on top of the glacier is almost all melted ($S_\mathrm{snow} < \SI{10}{mm}$),
glacier melt is enabled and estimated with a degree-day model. If the air temperature
$T_\mathrm{air}$ is above a melting temperature threshold
$\SIb{g_\mathrm{melt,T threshold}}{\degree C}$, glacier melt occurs. The potential glacier
melt $\SIb{M_\mathrm{glacier, pot}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$, using the degree-day factor
$\SIb{g_\mathrm{ddf}}{mm\ t^{-1}\ \degree C^{-1}}$, is calculated as:
$$
  M_\mathrm{glacier, pot}=\begin{cases}
    g_\mathrm{ddf} (T_\mathrm{air}-g_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}) & \text{if $T_\mathrm{air} > g_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}$}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise} .\\
  \end{cases}
$$

The actual glacier melt is limited by the glacier storage. Parameter $g_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}$
can be taken as equal to the snow $s_\mathrm{melt, T threshold}$ parameter. Values of the
melting factor $g_\mathrm{ddf}$ normally varies from one glacier to another and some values
are reported in the literature. $g_\mathrm{ddf}$ can also be estimated by multiplying snow
$s_\mathrm{ddf}$ by a factor between $1$ and $2$, to take into account the higher albedo of
ice compared to snow.

## Evaporation

The Land Hydrology `SBM` model assumes the input to be potential reference
evapotranspiration. A crop coefficient (set to $1$ by default) is used to convert the
potential evapotranspiration rate of a reference crop fully covering the soil to the
potential evapotranspiration rate of vegetation (natural and agricultural) fully covering
the soil. The crop coefficient is used for a surface completely covered by vegetation, and
does not include the effect of growing stages of vegetation and soil cover. These effects
are handled separately through the use of the canopy gap fraction.

It is assumed that the potential evaporation rate of intercepted water by vegetation is
equal to the potential evapotranspiration rate of vegetation (fully covering the soil)
multiplied by the canopy fraction. The potential evapotranspiration rate left over after
interception is available for transpiration. For potential open water evaporation (river and
water bodies) the potential reference evapotranspiration rate is used (multipled by the
river fraction, and open water fraction). Also for potential soil evaporation the potential
reference evapotranspiration rate is used, multiplied by the canopy gap fraction corrected
by the sum of total water fraction (river fraction and open water fraction) and the fraction
covered by a glacier.

### Bare soil evaporation

The fraction of bare soil is assumed to be equal to the fraction not covered by the canopy
gap fraction corrected by the total water fraction and glacier fraction. Bare soil
evaporation is only provided from the upper soil layer, and soil evaporation is split in
evaporation from the unsaturated store and evaporation from the saturated store. Water is
first evaporated from the unsaturated store. The remaining potential soil evaporation can be
used for evaporation from the saturated store, but only when the water table is present in
the upper soil layer. Both the evaporation from the unsaturated store and the evaporation
from the saturated store are limited by the minimum of the remaining potential soil
evaporation and the available water in the unsaturated/saturated zone of the upper soil
layer. The evaporation (both unsaturated and saturated) decreases linearly with decreasing
water availability, as indicated by the figure below.

### Transpiration

The maximum possible root water extraction rate for each unsaturated soil layer is
determined by partitioning the potential transpiration rate $T_p$ based on the fraction of
the total root length density in each unsaturated soil layer. The fractions of the total
root length density in each unsaturated soil layer are scaled by the inverse of the sum of
these fractions. Transpiration can then be fully satisfied from the unsaturated zone first,
independent of the water table that can intersect the root zone. Root water extraction is
limited by available soil water in each unsaturated soil layer that is a function of rooting
depth and water table depth illustrated in the conceptual figure below.

A root water uptake reduction model is used to calculate a reduction coefficient as a
function of soil water pressure, that may reduce the maximum possible root water extraction
rate. The root water uptake reduction model is based on the concept proposed by Feddes et
al. (1978). This concept defines a reduction coefficient $\SIb{\alpha}{-}$ as a function of
soil water pressure $\SIb{h}{cm}$. Four different levels of $h$ are defined: $h_1$, $h_2$,
$h_3$ and $h_4$. $h_1$ represents anoxic moisture conditions, $h_2$ represents field
capacity, $h_3$ represents the point of critical soil moisture content (onset of drought
stress), and $h_4$ represents the wilting point. The value of $h_3$ is a function of the
potential transpiration rate, between $\SI{1}{mm\ d^{-1}}$ and $\SI{5}{mm\ d^{-1}}$. If
$T_p \le \SI{1}{mm\ d^{-1}}$, $h_3$ is set equal to $h_{3\mathrm{low}}$ (input model
parameter). If $T_p \ge \SI{5}{mm d^{-1}}$, $h_3$ is set equal to $h_{3\mathrm{high}}$
(input model parameter). For $T_p$ values between $\SI{1}{mm\ d^{-1}}$ and
$\SI{5}{mm\ d^{-1}}$, the value of $h_3$ is linearly related to $T_p$ (between
$h_{3\mathrm{low}}$ and $h_{3\mathrm{high}}$). Besides model parameters $h_{3\mathrm{high}}$
and $h_{3\mathrm{low}}$, the critical pressure heads $h_1$, $h_2$ and $h_4$ can be defined
as input to the model.

The current soil water pressure is determined following the concept defined by Brooks and Corey
(1964):

$$
    \frac{\theta-\theta_r}{\theta_s-\theta_r} =  \min\left\{1, \left(\frac{h_b}{h}\right)^\lambda\right\},
$$

where $\SIb{h}{cm}$ is the pressure head, $\SIb{h_b}{cm}$ is the air entry pressure head, and
$\theta$, $\theta_s$, $\theta_r$ and $\lambda$ as previously defined.

Whenever the current soil water pressure drops below $h_4$, the root water uptake is set to
zero. The root water uptake is at ideal conditions whenever the soil water pressure is above
$h_3$, with a linear transition between $h_3$ and $h_4$. The assumption that very wet
conditions do not affect root water uptake too much is probably generally applicable to
natural vegetation. For crops this assumption is not valid and in this case root water
uptake above $h_1$ should be set to zero (oxygen deficit) and between $h_1$ and $h_2$ root
water uptake is limited. This is possible by setting $\alpha$ for $h_1$ at $0$ (default is
$1$) through model input.

# | fig-cap: "Root water uptake reduction coefficient as a function of soil water pressure"
using CairoMakie

let
  # Create figure
  fig = Figure(; size = (500, 400))

      fig[1, 1];

end
```

The computation of transpiration from the saturated store depends on the water table depth,
rooting depth, the reduction coefficient $\alpha$ and the fraction of wet roots. The
fraction of wet roots is determined using a sigmoid function (see figure below). The
parameter `rootdistpar` defines the sharpness of the transition between fully wet and fully
dry roots. The remaining potential transpiration is multiplied by the wet roots fraction and
$\alpha$ (and limited by the available water in saturated zone) to get the transpiration
from the saturated part of the soil.

## Soil processes

### The SBM soil water accounting scheme

A detailed description of the Topog_SBM model has been given by Vertessy and Elsenbeer
(1999). Briefly: the soil is considered as a bucket with a certain depth
$\SIb{z_\mathrm{soil}}{mm}$, divided into a saturated store $\SIb{S_\mathrm{sat}}{mm}$ and
an unsaturated store $\SIb{S_\mathrm{unsat}}{mm}$. The top of the $S_\mathrm{sat}$ store
forms a pseudo-water table at depth $\SIb{z_\mathrm{watertable}}{mm}$ such that the value of
$S_\mathrm{sat}$ at any time is given by:

$$
    S_\mathrm{sat} = (z_\mathrm{soil}-z_\mathrm{watertable}) (\theta_s-\theta_r),
$$

where $\SIb{\theta_{s}}{-}$ and $\SIb{\theta_{r}}{-}$ are the saturated and residual soil
water contents, respectively.

The unsaturated storage capacity $\SIb{S_\mathrm{unsat, max}}{mm}$ is defined as follows:

$$
    S_\mathrm{unsat, max} = z_\mathrm{soil} (\theta_s-\theta_r) - S_\mathrm{sat} - S_\mathrm{unsat}.
$$

The saturation deficit $\SIb{S_\mathrm{deficit}}{mm}$ for the soil profile as a whole is
defined as:

$$
    S_\mathrm{deficit} = (\theta_s-\theta_r) z_\mathrm{soil} - S_\mathrm{sat}.
$$

All infiltrating water enters the unsaturated store first. The soil bucket can be split-up
in different layers, by providing the thickness $\SIb{}{mm}$ of the layers in the TOML file.
The following example specifies three layers (from top to bottom) of $100$, $300$ and $800$
$\SI{}{mm}$:

```toml
[model]
soil_layer__thickness = [100, 300, 800]
```

The code checks for each grid cell the specified layers against the soil thickness
$\SIb{}{mm}$, and adds or removes (partly) layer(s) based on the soil thickness.

Assuming a unit head gradient, the potential transfer of water $\SIb{Q_{\mathrm{transfer,
pot,} n}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$ from an unsaturated layer $n$ is controlled by the vertical saturated
hydraulic conductivity $\SIb{K_{\mathrm{vz},n}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$, the effective saturation
degree of layer $n$, and a Brooks-Corey power coefficient $\SIb{c_n}{-}$ based on the pore
size distribution index $\SIb{\lambda_n}{-}$ (Brooks and Corey, 1964) of layer $n$:

$$
\begin{gathered}
    Q_{\mathrm{transfer, pot,} n} = K_{\mathrm{vz},n}\left(\frac{\theta_n-\theta_\mathrm{r}}{\theta_\mathrm{s}-\theta_\mathrm{r}}\right)^{c_n}\\
    c_n=\frac{2+3\lambda_n}{\lambda_n}.
\end{gathered}
$$

Four different saturated hydraulic conductivity depth profiles
(`saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile`) are available and a
`saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile` can be specified in the TOML file as follows:

```toml
[input.static]
saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile = "exponential_constant" # optional, one of ("exponential", "exponential_constant", "layered", "layered_exponential"), default is "exponential"
```

Soil measurements are often available for about the upper $\SI{1.5-2}{m}$ of the soil column
to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity, while these measurements are often lacking
for soil depths beyond $\SI{1.5-2}{m}$. These different profiles allow to extent the
saturated hydraulic conductivity profile based on measurements (either an exponential fit or
hydraulic conductivity value per soil layer) with an exponential or constant profile. By
default, with `saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile` "exponential", the vertical
saturated hydraulic conductivity $\SIb{K_{\mathrm{vz,} n}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$ of unsaturated soil
layer $n$ for $m$ unsaturated soil layers is given by:

$$
    K_{\mathrm{vz},n} = f_{\mathrm{Kv,} n} K_\mathrm{v0} \begin{cases}
     e^{(-f_\mathrm{Kv} z_{\mathrm{bottom},n})} & \text{if $n < m$}\\
     e^{(-f_\mathrm{Kv} z_\mathrm{watertable})} & \text{if $n = m$},\\
  \end{cases}
$$

where $\SIb{K_\mathrm{v0}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$ is the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity at
the soil surface, $\SIb{f_{\mathrm{Kv,} n}}{-}$ is an optional (default: $1.0$)
multiplication factor for each soil layer $n$ to correct the vertical saturated hydraulic
conductivity, $\SIb{\subtext{f}{Kv}}{mm^{-1}}$ is a scaling parameter and
$\SIb{z_{\mathrm{bottom},n}}{mm}$ is the soil depth at the bottom of soil layer $n$.

The plot below shows the relation between soil depth $z$ and vertical saturated hydraulic
conductivity $K_\mathrm{vz}$ for different values of $\subtext{f}{Kv}$.

```{julia}
# | code-fold: true
# | fig-cap: "Effect of different values of `f_Kv` on the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity profile"
using Printf
using CairoMakie

let
    set_theme!()
    fig = Figure()
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel=L"K_\mathrm{vz}\;[\mathrm{mm/day}]", ylabel=L"-z\;[\mathrm{mm}]")

    z = 0:5.0:1000
    kv = 100.0
    f = 0.6 ./ collect(50:150.0:800)

    for fi in f
        lines!(ax, kv .* exp.(-fi .* z), -z, label=@sprintf("%.2e", fi))
    end

    Legend(fig[1, 2], ax, L"f_\mathrm{Kv}")
    fig
end
```

With `saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile` "exponential\_constant", $K_{\mathrm{vz,}
n}$ declines exponentially (if $f_{\mathrm{Kv,} n} = 1.0$) with soil depth $\SIb{z}{mm}$
until $\SIb{z_\mathrm{exp}}{mm}$ below the soil surface, and stays constant at and beyond
soil depth $z_\mathrm{exp}$ by default ($f_{\mathrm{Kv,} n} = 1.0$):

$$
    K_{\mathrm{vz,} n} = f_{\mathrm{Kv,} n} K_\mathrm{v0} \begin{cases}
    e^{-\subtext{f}{Kv} z_{\mathrm{bottom,} n}} & \text{if $z_{\mathrm{bottom,} n} < \subtext{z}{exp}$}\\
    e^{-\subtext{f}{Kv}\subtext{z}{exp}} & \text{if $z_{\mathrm{bottom,} n} \ge \subtext{z}{exp}$}.
    \end{cases}
$$

It is also possible to provide a vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity value per soil
layer by specifying `saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile` "layered", these values are
used in combination with $f_{\mathrm{Kv,} n}$ to compute the vertical transfer of water
between unsaturated soil layers and to the saturated store $S_\mathrm{sat}$. Finally, with
the `saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile` "layered\_exponential" $K_{\mathrm{vz,} n}$
for depth $z_\mathrm{layered}$ below the soil surface is based on provided vertical
saturated hydraulic conductivity values (in combination with $f_{\mathrm{Kv,} n}$), and
beyond $z_\mathrm{layered}$, $K_{\mathrm{vz,} n}$ is controlled by $K_\mathrm{vz}$ of layer
$n$ with bottom $z_\mathrm{layered}$, $\subtext{f}{Kv}$ and $f_{\mathrm{Kv,} n}$. The
different available `saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile` options are schematized in
the figure below:

![Overview of available `saturated_hydraulic_conductivity_profile` options, for a soil column with five layers](../../images/sbm_ksat_profiles.png)

The potential transfer of water from the unsaturated store to the saturated store is in that
case controlled by the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity at the water table depth
$\SIb{z_\mathrm{watertable}}{mm}$, an optional multiplication factor $\SIb{f_\mathrm{Kv,
1}}{-}$ to correct the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity, and the ratio between
$\SIb{S_\mathrm{unsat}}{mm}$ and $\SIb{S_\mathrm{deficit}}{mm}$:

$$
    Q_{\mathrm{transfer, pot,} 1} = f_{\mathrm{Kv,} 1} K_\mathrm{v0} e^{-\subtext{f}{Kv} z_\mathrm{watertable}}\frac{S_\mathrm{unsat}}{S_\mathrm{deficit}}.
$$

### Infiltration

The water available for infiltration is taken as throughfall, stemflow, snow runoff and
glaciermelt. Infiltration is determined separately for the compacted and non-compacted
areas, as these have different infiltration capacities. The infiltration capacity of
non-compacted areas is based on the vertical saturated conductivity at the soil surface
$\SIb{K_\mathrm{v0}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$ and an optional multiplication factor $\SIb{f_\mathrm{Kv,
1}}{-}$ to correct the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the upper soil layer.
Naturally, only the water that can be stored in the soil can infiltrate. If not all water
can infiltrate, this is added as excess water to the runoff routing scheme.

The infiltrating water is split in two parts, the part that falls on compacted areas and the
part that falls on non-compacted areas. The maximum infiltration rate in these areas is
calculated by taking the minimum of the infiltration capacity and the infiltration rate for
these areas. The actual total infiltration rate is a function of the total infiltration rate
(compacted and non-compacted areas) and the initial unsaturated storage capacity.

Infiltration excess occurs when the infiltration capacity is smaller then the water
available for infiltration. This amount of water becomes overland flow (infiltration excess
overland flow). Saturation excess occurs when the (upper) soil becomes saturated and water
cannot infiltrate anymore. This amount of water becomes overland flow (saturation excess
overland flow).

#### Infiltration in frozen soils

An optional reduction factor is applied to the infiltration capacity when snow is modelled,
and the model setting `soil_infiltration_reduction__flag` is set to true:

```toml
[model]
soil_infiltration_reduction__flag = true
snow__flag = true
```
This reduction factor depends on the near-surface soil temperature, which is modelled based
on the approach of Wigmosta et al., 2009:

$$
T_\mathrm{soil}^t = T_\mathrm{soil}^{t-1} + w_\mathrm{soil}  (T_\mathrm{air} - T_\mathrm{soil}^{t-1}),
$$
where $\SIb{T_\mathrm{soil}^{t}}{\degree C}$ is the near-surface soil temperature at time
step $t$, $\SIb{T_a}{\degree C}$ is air temperature at time step $t$,
$\SIb{T_\mathrm{soil}^{t-1}}{\degree C}$ is the near-surface soil temperature at the
previous time step and $\SIb{w_\mathrm{soil}}{t^{-1}}$ is a weighting coefficient determined
through calibration (default is 0.1125 for daily timesteps). The optional infiltration
capacity reduction factor is based on the model parameter $\SIb{f_\mathrm{red, frozen}}{-}$
(default is 0.038) and the near-surface soil temperature as follows:

$$
\begin{gathered}
    b = \frac{1.0}{1.0 - f_\mathrm{red, frozen}}\\
    f_\mathrm{frozen} = \frac{1.0}{b + \exp(-c (T_\mathrm{soil} - a))} + f_\mathrm{red, frozen}\\
    a = 0.0\\
    c = 8.0.
\end{gathered}
$$

A S-curve (see plot below) is used to make a smooth transition (a c-factor ($c$) of 8.0 is
used):

```{julia}
# | code-fold: true
# | fig-cap: "Infiltration correction factor as a function of soil temperature"
using CairoMakie
using Wflow: infiltration_reduction_factor

let
  # Define data
  temps = collect(-3:0.1:3)
  cf_soils = [0.038, 0.1, 0.2]  # Example values for cf_soil
  colors = ["#bae4bc", "#7bccc4", "#2b8cbe"]  # Colors for each cf_soil

  # Create figure
  fig = Figure(; size = (500, 400))
  ax = Axis(
      fig[1, 1];
      xlabel = "Soil temperature [°C]",
      ylabel = "Infiltration correction factor [-]",
      xgridvisible = false,
      ygridvisible = false,
  )

  # Plot lines for each cf_soil
  for (cf_soil, color) in zip(cf_soils, colors)
      y_vals = @. infiltration_reduction_factor(
          temps,
          cf_soil;
          modelsnow = true,
          soil_infiltration_reduction = true,
      )
      lines!(ax, temps, y_vals; label = "$cf_soil", color = color)
  end

  # Add legend
  axislegend("cf_soil"; framevisible = false, position = :lt)

  # Set axis limits
  xlims!(ax, minimum(temps), maximum(temps))
  ylims!(ax, -0.03, 1.03)

  # Display the figure
  fig
end
```

### Capillary rise

Capillary rise is determined when an unsaturated zone occurs in the soil column, using the
following approach. First a maximum capillary rise is determined from the minimum of
vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity at the water table, the actual transpiration rate
from the unsaturated store and the unsaturated storage capacity. Then, the maximum capillary
rate is scaled using the following empirical equation (e.g. Zammouri, 2011; Yang et al.,
2011; Wang et al., 2016):
$$
  C_\mathrm{act}=\begin{cases}
    C_\mathrm{max}\left(1-\frac{z_\mathrm{watertable}}{z_\mathrm{cap, maxdepth}}\right)^{n_\mathrm{cap}} & \text{if $(z_\mathrm{watertable}>z_\mathrm{rooting})$ \& $(z_\mathrm{watertable}<z_\mathrm{cap, maxdepth})$}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise},
  \end{cases}
$$
where $\SIb{C_\mathrm{act}}{mm\ t^{-1}}$ is the capillary rate, $\SIb{z_\mathrm{cap,
maxdepth}}{mm}$ is the critical water depth beyond which capillary rise ceases,
$\SIb{n_\mathrm{cap}}{-}$ is an empirical coefficient related to soil properties and
climate, generally set between $1$ and $3$, $\SIb{z_\mathrm{watertable}}{mm}$ is the water
table depth and $\SIb{z_\mathrm{rooting}}{mm}$ is the rooting depth. $C_\mathrm{act}$ is
divided over the different unsaturated soil layers, from the bottom to the top unsaturated
soil layer, without exceeding the saturated water content.

### Leakage

If the maximum leakage $\SIb{}{mm\ d^{-1}}$ input model parameter is set > 0, water is lost
from the saturated zone and runs out of the model. Leakage can be enabled by specifying the
following in the TOML file:

```toml
[input.static]
soil_water_saturated_zone_bottom__max_leakage_volume_flux = "maxleakage"
```

## Open water

Part of the water available for infiltration is diverted to the open water, based on the
fractions of river and reservoirs of each grid cell. The amount of evaporation from open
water is assumed to be equal to potential evaporation (if sufficient water is available).

## Non-irrigation
Non-irrigation water demand and allocation computations are supported for the sectors domestic,
industry and livestock. These computations can be enabled by specifying the following in the
TOML file:

```toml
[model.water_demand]
domestic__flag = true
industry__flag = true
livestock__flag = true
```

For these non-irrigation sectors the gross demand ($d_\mathrm{gross}$ $\SIb{}{mm\ t^{-1}}$)
and net demand ($d_\mathrm{net}$ $\SIb{}{mm\ t^{-1}}$) are provided to the model (input
through cyclic $\SIb{}{mm\ d^{-1}}$ or forcing data $\SIb{}{mm\ t^{-1}}$). Gross demand
represents the total demand and hence the total abstraction from surface water or
groundwater when sufficient water is available. Net demand represents water consumption. The
portion of total abstracted water that is not consumed is returned as surface water. The
return flow fraction ($\SIb{f_\mathrm{return}}{-}$) is calculated as follows:

$$
    \subtext{f}{return} = 1.0 - \frac{\subtext{d}{net}}{\subtext{d}{gross}},
$$
and used to calculate the return flow rate (water abstracted from surface water or
groundwater but not consumed). For grid cells containing a river the return flow is directly
returned to the river routing component, otherwise the return flow is returned to the
overland flow routing component.

The list of input parameters for non-irrigation that can be provided through the TOML file
can be found [here](../parameters_landhydrology_sbm.qmd#non-irrigation).

## Non-paddy irrigation
Non-paddy (other crops than flooded rice) water demand and allocation computations are
supported. These computations can be enabled by specifying the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model.water_demand]
nonpaddy__flag = true
```
Irrigation is applied during the growing season when input parameter irrigation trigger
$\SIb{}{-}$ for non-paddy irrigation is `true` (or `on`) and when water depletion exceeds
the readily available water:

$$
    (\subtext{S}{root-unsat, fc} - \subtext{S}{root-unsat}) \ge (\subtext{S}{root-unsat, fc} - \subtext{S}{root-unsat, h3}),
$$
where $\SIb{\subtext{S}{root-unsat, fc}}{mm}$ is the unsaturated store in the root zone at
field capacity (defined at a soil water pressure head of $\SI{-100}{cm}$),
$\SIb{\subtext{S}{root-unsat}}{mm}$ is the unsaturated store in the root zone and
$\SIb{\subtext{S}{root-unsat, h3}}{mm}$ is the unsaturated store in the root zone at the
critical soil water pressure head $h_3$, below this pressure head reduction of root water
uptake starts due to drought stress. The net irrigation demand $\SIb{}{mm\ t^{-1}}$ is the
irrigation rate that brings the root zone back to field capacity, limited by the soil
infiltration capacity $\SIb{}{mm\ t^{-1}}$, assuming that farmers do not apply an irrigation
rate higher than the soil infiltration capacity. To account for limited irrigation
efficiency the net irrigation demand is divided by the irrigation efficiency for non-paddy
crops ($\SIb{}{-}$, default is $1.0$), resulting in gross irrigation demand $\SIb{}{mm\ t^{-1}}$.
Finally, the gross irrigation demand is limited by the maximum irrigation rate
($\SIb{}{mm\ t^{-1}}$, default is $\SI{25}{mm\ d^{-1}}$). If the maximum irrigation rate is
applied, irrigation continues at subsequent time steps until field capacity is reached.
Irrigation is added to the amount of water available for infiltration.

The list of input parameters for non-paddy irrigation that can be provided through the TOML
file can be found [here](../parameters_landhydrology_sbm.qmd#non-paddy-irrigation).

## Paddy irrigation
Paddy (flooded rice) water demand and allocation computations are supported. These computations
can be enabled by specifying the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model.water_demand]
paddy__flag = true
```
Irrigation is applied during the growing season when input parameter irrigation trigger
$\SIb{}{-}$ is `true` (or `on`) and when the paddy water depth `h` $\SIb{}{mm}$ reaches
below the minimum water depth `h_min` $\SIb{}{mm}$ (see also the figure below). The net
irrigation demand $\SIb{}{mm\ t^{-1}}$ is the irrigation rate required to reach the optimal
paddy water depth `h_opt` $\SIb{}{mm}$, an approach similar to Xie and Cui (2011). To
account for limited irrigation efficiency the net irrigation demand is divided by the
irrigation efficiency for paddy fields ($\SIb{}{-}$, default is 1.0), resulting in gross
irrigation demand $\SIb{}{mm t^{-1}}$. Finally, the gross irrigation demand is limited by
the maximum irrigation rate ($\SIb{}{mm\ t^{-1}}$, default is $\SIb{25}{mm\ d^{-1}}$). If
the maximum irrigation rate is applied, irrigation continues at subsequent time steps until
the optimal paddy water depth `h_opt` is reached. Irrigation is added to the amount of water
available for infiltration. When the paddy water depth `h` exceeds `h_max` $\SIb{}{mm}$
runoff occurs, and this amount is added to the runoff routing scheme for overland flow. The
figure below shows a typical vertical soil profile of a puddled rice soil with a muddy layer
of about 15 cm (in this case represented by two soil layers of $\SI{5}{cm}$ and
$\SI{10}{cm}$ thickness), a plow soil layer of 5 cm with relative low permeability (vertical
hydraulic conductivity $\subtext{K}{vz}$ of about $\SI{5}{mm\ d^{-1}}$), and a non-puddled
soil below the plow soil layer. The low vertical hydraulic conductivity of the plow soil
layer can be realized by making use of the optional multiplication factor
$\SIb{f_{\mathrm{Kv,} n}}{-}$ (default is 1.0) applied to each soil layer $n$.

![Schematic diagram of a paddy field with water balance components and soil profile](../../images/paddy_profile.png)

The list of input parameters for paddy irrigation that can be provided through the TOML file
can be found [here](../parameters_landhydrology_sbm.qmd#paddy-irrigation).

## Water withdrawal and allocation
For the water withdrawal the total gross demand is computed (sum over the irrigation and
non-irrigation water demand sectors), in case sufficient water is available the water
withdrawal is equal to the total gross demand. In case of insufficient water availability, the
water withdrawal is scaled down to the available water, and allocation is then proportional to
the gross demand per sector (industry, domestic, livestock and irrigation). Water can be
abstracted from the following sources:

- surface water from rivers (max $\SI{80}{\%}$ of total available water)
- reservoirs (max $\SI{98}{\%}$ of total available water)
- groundwater (max $\SI{75}{\%}$ of total available water)

The model parameter fraction surface water used (default is $1.0$) determines how much water
is supplied by available surface water and groundwater, and can be specified in the TOML
file as follows:

```toml
[input.static]
land_surface_water__withdrawal_fraction = "SurfaceWaterFrac"
```

### Local
First, surface water abstraction (excluding reservoir locations) is computed to satisfy
local (same grid cell) water demand. The available surface water volume is limited by a
fixed scaling factor of $0.8$ to prevent rivers from completely drying out. It is assumed
that the water demand cannot be satisfied completely from local surface water and
groundwater. The next step is to satisfy the remaining water demand for allocation areas
$\SIb{}{-}$, described in the next sub-section.

### Allocation areas
Allocation areas can be specified as follows in the TOML file:

```toml
[input.static]
land_water_allocation_area__count = "allocation_areas"
```

For allocation areas the water demand $\SIb{\subtext{V}{sw, demand}}{m^3}$ and availability
$\SIb{\subtext{V}{sw, availabilty}}{m^3}$ are summed (including reservoir locations limited
by a fixed scaling factor of $0.98$), and the total surface water abstraction is then:

$$
    \subtext{V}{sw, abstraction} = \min (\subtext{V}{sw, demand}, \subtext{V}{sw, availabilty}).
$$
The fraction of available surface water that can be abstracted
$\SIb{\subtext{f}{sw,abstraction}}{-}$ at the allocation area level is then:

$$
    \subtext{f}{sw, abstraction} = \frac{\subtext{V}{sw, abstraction}}{\subtext{V}{sw, available}}.
$$
This fraction is applied to the remaining available surface water of each river cell
(including reservoir locations) to compute surface water abstraction at each river cell and
to update the local surface water abstraction.

The fraction of water demand that can be satisfied by available surface water
$\SIb{\subtext{f}{sw, allocation}}{-}$ at the allocation area level is then:

$$
    \subtext{f}{sw, allocation} = \frac{\subtext{V}{sw, abstraction}}{\subtext{V}{sw, demand}}.
$$
This fraction is applied to the remaining surface water demand of each land cell to compute the
allocated surface water to each land cell.

Then groundwater abstraction is computed to satisfy the remaining local water demand, where
groundwater abstraction is limited by a fixed scaling factor of $0.75$ applied to the
groundwater volume. Finally, for allocation areas the water demand
$\SIb{\subtext{V}{gw,demand}}{m^3}$ and availability $\SIb{\subtext{V}{gw, availabilty}}{m^3}$
are summed, and the total groundwater abstraction is then:

$$
    \subtext{V}{gw, abstraction} = \min(\subtext{V}{gw, demand}, \subtext{V}{gw, availabilty}).
$$
The fraction of available groundwater that can be abstracted at allocation area level
$\SIb{\subtext{f}{gw, abstraction}}{-}$ at the allocation area level is then:

$$
    \subtext{f}{gw, abstraction} = \frac{\subtext{V}{gw, abstraction}}{\subtext{V}{gw, available}}.
$$
This fraction is applied to the remaining available groundwater of each land cell to compute
groundwater abstraction and to update the local groundwater abstraction.

The fraction of water demand that can be satisfied by available groundwater
$\SIb{\subtext{f}{gw,allocation}}{-}$ at the allocation area level is then:

$$
    \subtext{f}{gw, allocation} = \frac{\subtext{V}{gw, abstraction}}{\subtext{V}{gw, demand}}.
$$
This fraction is applied to the remaining groundwater demand of each land cell to compute the
allocated groundwater to each land cell.

### Abstractions
Groundwater abstraction is implemented by subtracting this amount from the recharge variable
of the lateral subsurface flow component (kinematic wave) or the recharge rate variable of
the groundwater flow module. Surface water abstraction $\SIb{}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ is divided by
the flow length $\SIb{}{m}$ and subtracted from the lateral inflow of kinematic wave routing
scheme for river flow. For the local inertial routing scheme (river and optional floodplain
routing), the surface water abstraction $\SIb{}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ is subtracted as part of the
continuity equation of the local inertial model. For reservoir locations surface water is
abstracted $\SIb{}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ from the reservoir storage $\SIb{}{m^3}$, with a subsequent
update of the reservoir water level $\SIb{}{m}$.
