title: Introduction

This section provides an overview of all model parameters, states and variables in tables
that can be exchanged (input and output) with standard names (subsection below) for:

+ [The Land Hydrology SBM model](./parameters_landhydrology_sbm.qmd).
+ [The Land Sediment model](./parameters_sediment.qmd)
+ [Routing concepts](./parameters_routing.qmd)

These tables include standard names, descriptions, units and default values (input
parameters) for model parameters, states and variables.

## Standard names
The standard names of model parameters, states and variables are based on [CSDMS Standard
Names](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Standard_Names). These standard names are used
in the TOML configuration file and mapped to internal model parameters, states and
variables. Model output of model parameters (`[output]` section of TOML file) is not
possible by providing standard names as these are only used for setting model parameters
during model initialization, except for parameters that can also have cyclic input. These
parameters are listed in tables below "Input static and cyclic" subsections (for
[example](./parameters_landhydrology_sbm.qmd#input-cyclic-lai)). To output model parameters
and variables without a standard name one to one mapping (dot notation) can be used in the
TOML configuration file, but this is not considered as part of the public API, e.g.:

```toml
[output.netcdf_grid.variables]
land.interception.variables.canopy_storage = "canopystorage"
```

Standard names that contain `instantaneous` in the `quantity` part of the standard name are
valid for an internal time step and thus considered instantaneous compared to the model
simulation time step. Standard names can contain a tilde that are used to distinguish nouns
and adjectives in the `object` part of the standard name. These standard names should be
quoted in the TOML configuration file, e.g.:

```toml
[input.static]
"soil~compacted__area_fraction".value = 0.2
```

## Generic input maps {#input-generic}
The table below lists static input maps that are not directly part of wflow models and are
required to run wflow. 

| Standard Name | Description | Unit | Default value |
| ---- | ----- | - | -- |
| `local_drain_direction` | Local drain direction (1-9) | - | - |
| `subcatchment_location__count` | Subcatchment ids | - | - |
| `river_location__mask` | River mask (0-1) | - | - |
: {.striped .hover}

For lake and reservoir generic input see
[lake-input](./parameters_routing.qmd#input-generic-lake) and
[reservoir-input](./parameters_routing.qmd#input-generic-reservoir), respectively.
