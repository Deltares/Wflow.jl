title: Reservoirs and Lakes
---

 Reservoirs and lakes models can be included as part of the river network.

## Reservoirs
By default the reservoirs are not included in the model. To include them put the following
lines in the TOML file of the model:

```toml
[model]
reservoir__flag = true
```
Finally there is a mapping required between external and internal parameter names in the TOML
file, with below an example:

```toml
[input]
reservoir_area__count = "wflow_reservoirareas"
reservoir_location__count = "wflow_reservoirlocs"

[input.static]
reservoir_surface__area = "ResSimpleArea"
"reservoir_water_demand~required~downstream__volume_flow_rate" = "ResDemand"
reservoir_water_release-below-spillway__max_volume_flow_rate = "ResMaxRelease"
reservoir_water__max_volume = "ResMaxVolume"
"reservoir_water~full-target__volume_fraction" = "ResTargetFullFrac"
"reservoir_water~min-target__volume_fraction" = "ResTargetMinFrac"
```
The list of reservoir input parameters that can be provided through the TOML file can be
found [here](../parameters_routing.qmd#reservoirs).

### Lakes (unregulated and regulated)
Lakes are modelled using a mass balance approach:

$$
    \dfrac{S(t + \Delta t)}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{S(t)}{\Delta t} + \subtext{Q}{in} + \dfrac{(P-E) A}{\Delta t} - \subtext{Q}{out}
$$

where $\SIb{S}{m^3}$ is lake storage, $\SIb{\Delta t}{s}$ is the model timestep,
$\SIb{\subtext{Q}{in}}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ is the sum of inflows (river, overland and lateral
subsurface flow), $\SIb{\subtext{Q}{out}}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ is the lake outflow at the outlet,
$\SIb{P}{m}$ is precipitation, $\SIb{E}{m}$ is lake evaporation and $\SIb{A}{m^2}$ is the
lake surface area.

Most of the variables in this equation are known at the current or previous timestep, apart
from $S(t+ \Delta t)$ and $\subtext{Q}{out}$ which can both be linked to the water level $H$
in the lake using a storage curve $S = f(H)$ and a rating curve $Q = f(H)$. In wflow,
several options are available to select storage and rating curves, and in most cases, the
mass balance is then solved by linearization and iteration or using the Modified Puls
Approach from Maniak (Burek et al., 2013). Storage curves in wflow can either:

+ Come from the interpolation of field data linking volume and lake height,
+ Be computed from the simple relationship $S = A H$.

Rating curves in wflow can either:

+ Come from the interpolation of field data linking lake outflow and water height, also
  appropriate for regulated lakes/ dams,
+ Be computed from a rating curve of the form $\subtext{Q}{out} = \alpha (H-H_0)^\beta$, where
  $H_{0}$ is the minimum water level under which the outflow is zero. Usual values for $\beta$
  are $\frac{3}{2}$ for a rectangular weir or $2$ for a parabolic weir (Bos, 1989).

### Modified Puls Approach
The Modified Puls Approach is a resolution method of the lake balance that uses an explicit
relationship between storage and outflow. Storage is assumed to be equal to $A H$ and the
rating curve for a parabolic weir ($\beta = 2$):

$$
    S = A H = A  (h + H_{0}) = A \sqrt{\frac{Q}{\alpha}} + A H_0
$$

Inserting this equation in the mass balance gives:

$$
    \dfrac{A}{\Delta t} \sqrt{\frac{Q}{\alpha}} + Q = \dfrac{S(t)}{\Delta t} + \subtext{Q}{in} +
    A\dfrac{P-E}{\Delta t} - \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t} = \mathrm{SI} - \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t}
$$

The solution for $Q$ is then:

$$
  Q =
    \begin{cases}
      \begin{align*}
        \frac{1}{4}\left(-\mathrm{LF} + \sqrt{\mathrm{LF}^{2} + 4  \left(\mathrm{SI} - \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t} \right)}
        \right)^2 &\text{ if }\quad \mathrm{SI} > \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t} \\
        0 &\text{ if }\quad \mathrm{SI} \leq \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t}
      \end{align*}
    \end{cases}
$$

where

$$
 \mathrm{LF} = \dfrac{A}{\Delta t \sqrt{\alpha}}.
$$

### Lake parameters
By default, the lakes are not included in the model. To include them, put the following line in
the TOML file of the model:

```toml
[model]
lake__flag = true
```
There is also a mapping required between external and internal parameter names in the TOML
file, with below an example:

```toml
[input]
lake_location__count = "wflow_lakelocs"
lake_area__count = "wflow_lakeareas"

[input.static]
lake_surface__area = "lake_area"
lake_water__rating_curve_coefficient = "lake_b"
lake_water__rating_curve_exponent = "lake_e"
lake_water__rating_curve_type_count = "lake_outflowfunc"
lake_water__storage_curve_type_count  = "lake_storfunc"
lake_water_flow_threshold-level__elevation  = "lake_threshold"
lake_water_level__initial_elevation = "lake_waterlevel"
```

The list of lake input parameters that can be provided through the TOML file can be found
[here](../parameters_routing.qmd#lakes). The following lake storage curve types
`lake_water__storage_curve_type_count` are available:

+ 1 for  $S = AH$
+ 2 for  $S = f(H)$ from lake data and interpolation

And the following lake rating curve types `lake_water__rating_curve_type_count` are
available:

+ 1 for $Q = f(H)$ from lake data and interpolation
+ 2 for general $Q = b(H - H_{0})^{e}$
+ 3 in the case of Puls Approach $Q = b(H - H_{0})^{2}$

### Additional settings
Storage and rating curves from field measurement can be supplied to wflow via CSV files
supplied in the same folder of the TOML file. Naming of the files uses the ID of the lakes
where data are available and is of the form `lake_sh_1.csv` and `lake_hq_1.csv` for
respectively the storage and rating curves of lake with ID 1.

The storage curve is stored in a CSV file with lake level $\SIb{}{m}$ in the first column `H`
and corresponding lake storage $\SIb{}{m^3}$ in the second column `S`:

```bash
H,  S
392.21, 0
393.21, 430202000
393.71, 649959000
394.21, 869719000
```

The rating curve uses level and discharge data depending on the Julian day of the year (JDOY),
and can be also used for regulated lakes/ dams. The first line contains `H` for the first
column. The other lines contain the water level and the corresponding discharges for the
different JDOY (1-365), see also the example below, that shows part of a CSV file (first 4
Julian days). The volume above the maximum water level of the rating curve is assumed to flow
instantaneously out of the lake (overflow).

```bash
H
394,    43,     43,     43,     43
394.01, 44.838, 44.838, 44.838, 44.838
394.02, 46.671, 46.671, 46.671, 46.671
394.03, 48.509, 48.509, 48.509, 48.509
394.04, 50.347, 50.347, 50.347, 50.347
394.05, 52.179, 52.179, 52.179, 52.179
```

Linked lakes: In some cases, lakes can be linked and return flow can be allowed from the
downstream to the upstream lake. The linked lakes are defined in the
`lake~lower_location__count` (standard name) input parameter that represent the downstream
lake location ID, at the grid cell of the upstream lake location.

::: {.callout-note}
In every file, level units are meters [m] above lake bottom and not meters above sea level [m
asl]. Especially with storage/rating curves coming from data, please be careful and convert
units if needed.
