title: Reservoirs
---

For modelling reservoirs, (natural) lakes or other water storage features that can be
represented by the available functionality, a `reservoir` node is used that can be included
as part of the river network.

## General settings
By default the reservoirs are not included in the model. To include them put the following
lines in the TOML file of the model:

```toml
[model]
reservoir__flag = true
```
Reservoir areas (coverage) and locations (outlet) are required and mapped between external
and internal parameter names in the TOML file, with below an example:

```toml
[input]
reservoir_area__count = "wflow_reservoirareas"
reservoir_location__count = "wflow_reservoirlocs"
```

## Reservoir modelling
Reservoirs are modelled using a mass balance approach:

$$
    \dfrac{S(t + \Delta t)}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{S(t)}{\Delta t} + \subtext{Q}{in} + \dfrac{(P-E) A}{\Delta t} - \subtext{Q}{out}
$$

where $\SIb{S}{m^3}$ is reservoir storage, $\SIb{\Delta t}{s}$ is the model timestep,
$\SIb{\subtext{Q}{in}}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ is the sum of inflows (river, overland and lateral
subsurface flow), $\SIb{\subtext{Q}{out}}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ is the reservoir outflow at the
outlet, $\SIb{P}{m}$ is precipitation, $\SIb{E}{m}$ is reservoir evaporation and
$\SIb{A}{m^2}$ is the reservoir surface area.

Most of the variables in this equation are known at the current or previous timestep, apart
from $S(t+ \Delta t)$ and $\subtext{Q}{out}$ which can both be linked to the water level $H$
in the reservoir using a storage curve $S = f(H)$ and a rating curve $Q = f(H)$. In wflow,
several options are available to select storage and rating curves, and in most cases, the
mass balance is then solved explicitly or by using the Modified Puls approach from Maniak
(Burek et al., 2013). Storage curves in wflow can either:

+ Come from the interpolation of field data linking volume and reservoir water level,
+ Be computed from the simple relationship $S = A H$.

Rating curves in wflow can either:

+ Come from the interpolation of field data linking reservoir outflow and water level
+ Be computed from a rating curve of the form $\subtext{Q}{out} = \alpha (H-H_0)^\beta$, where
  $H_{0}$ is the minimum water level under which the outflow is zero. Usual values for $\beta$
  are $\frac{3}{2}$ for a rectangular weir or $2$ for a parabolic weir (Bos, 1989).
+ Be defined by simple reservoir operational parameters.

### Modified Puls approach
The Modified Puls approach is solving the reservoir balance using an explicit relationship
between storage and outflow. Storage is assumed to be equal to $A H$ and the rating curve
for a parabolic weir ($\beta = 2$) is used:

$$
    S = A H = A  (h + H_{0}) = A \sqrt{\frac{Q}{\alpha}} + A H_0
$$

Inserting this equation in the mass balance gives:

$$
    \dfrac{A}{\Delta t} \sqrt{\frac{Q}{\alpha}} + Q = \dfrac{S(t)}{\Delta t} + \subtext{Q}{in} +
    A\dfrac{P-E}{\Delta t} - \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t} = \mathrm{SI} - \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t}
$$

The solution for $Q$ is then:

$$
  Q =
    \begin{cases}
      \begin{align*}
        \frac{1}{4}\left(-\mathrm{LF} + \sqrt{\mathrm{LF}^{2} + 4  \left(\mathrm{SI} - \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t} \right)}
        \right)^2 &\text{ if }\quad \mathrm{SI} > \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t} \\
        0 &\text{ if }\quad \mathrm{SI} \leq \dfrac{A H_0}{\Delta t}
      \end{align*}
    \end{cases}
$$

where

$$
 \mathrm{LF} = \dfrac{A}{\Delta t \sqrt{\alpha}}.
$$

### Reservoir parameters
The following reservoir rating curve types `reservoir_water__rating_curve_type_count` are
available:

+ 1 for $Q = f(H)$ from reservoir data and interpolation
+ 2 for general $Q = b(H - H_{0})^{e}$
+ 3 in the case of Modified Puls approach $Q = b(H - H_{0})^{2}$
+ 4 simple reservoir operational parameters

And following reservoir storage curve types `reservoir_water__storage_curve_type_count` are
available:

+ 1 for  $S = AH$
+ 2 for  $S = f(H)$ from reservoir data and interpolation

Below an example of how the reservoir area, rating curve and storage curve types, required
data for all reservoir types, are mapped between external and internal parameter names in
the TOML file:

```toml
[input.static]
reservoir_surface__area = "reservoir_area"
reservoir_water__rating_curve_type_count = "outflowfunc"
reservoir_water__storage_curve_type_count = "storfunc"
```

Including reservoir rating and storage curves from data (rating curve type 1 and storage
curve type 2) is described [here](#storage-and-rating-cuves-from-data).

For reservoir rating curve types 2 and 3 the following rating curve parameters need to be
included in the TOML file, with below an example:

```toml
[input.static]
reservoir_water__rating_curve_coefficient = "reservoir_b"
reservoir_water__rating_curve_exponent = "reservoir_e"
reservoir_water_flow_threshold-level__elevation = "reservoir_threshold"
```

A reservoir with rating curve type 2 can be linked to a downstream reservoir and return flow
can be allowed from the downstream to the upstream reservoir. The input parameter
`reservoir~lower_location__count` (standard name) represents the downstream reservoir
location ID of the upstream lake location.

For reservoir rating curve type 4, simple reservoir operational parameters need to included
in the TOML file, with below an example:

```toml
[input.static]
"reservoir_water_demand~required~downstream__volume_flow_rate" = "ResDemand"
reservoir_water_release-below-spillway__max_volume_flow_rate = "ResMaxRelease"
reservoir_water__max_volume = "ResMaxVolume"
"reservoir_water~full-target__volume_fraction" = "ResTargetFullFrac"
"reservoir_water~min-target__volume_fraction" = "ResTargetMinFrac"
```

The complete list of reservoir input parameters that can be provided through the TOML file can be
found [here](../parameters_routing.qmd#reservoirs).

### Storage and rating cuves from data
Storage and rating curves from field measurement can be supplied to wflow via CSV files
supplied in the same folder of the TOML file. Naming of the files uses the ID of the
reservoirs where data are available and is of the form `reservoir_sh_1.csv` and
`reservoir_hq_1.csv` for respectively the storage and rating curves of reservoir with ID 1.

The storage curve is stored in a CSV file with reservoir level $\SIb{}{m}$ in the first
column `H` and corresponding reservoir storage $\SIb{}{m^3}$ in the second column `S`:

```bash
H,  S
392.21, 0
393.21, 430202000
393.71, 649959000
394.21, 869719000
```

The rating curve uses level and discharge data depending on the Julian day of the year
(JDOY). The first line contains `H` for the first column. The other lines contain the water
level and the corresponding discharges for the different JDOY (1-365), see also the example
below, that shows part of a CSV file (first 4 Julian days). The volume above the maximum
water level of the rating curve is assumed to flow instantaneously out of the reservoir
(overflow).

```bash
H
394,    43,     43,     43,     43
394.01, 44.838, 44.838, 44.838, 44.838
394.02, 46.671, 46.671, 46.671, 46.671
394.03, 48.509, 48.509, 48.509, 48.509
394.04, 50.347, 50.347, 50.347, 50.347
394.05, 52.179, 52.179, 52.179, 52.179
```

::: {.callout-note}
Please note that `H` in these two examples is defined as meters above sea level. When using
option (1) for the storage curve, the level is defined as meters above reservoir bottom.
Therefore, please be careful to ensure consistent units when using/combining storage and
rating curves from data.
