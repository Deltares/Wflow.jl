title: Sediment flux
---

Both the inland and river sediment model take into account sediment flux or transport of
sediment in water, either in overland flow or in the stream flow. These two transport are
distinguished in two different structures.

## Inland Sediment Model

### Sediment Flux in overland flow
Once the amount of soil detached by both rainfall and overland flow has been estimated, it
has then to be routed and delivered to the river network. Inland routing in sediment models
is usually done by comparing the amount of detached sediment with the transport capacity of
the flow, which is the maximum amount of sediment that the flow can carry downslope. There
are several existing formulas available in the literature. For a wide range of slopes and
for overland flow, the Govers equation (1990) seems the most appropriate choice (Hessel et
al, 2007). However, as the wflow\_sediment model was developed to be linked to water quality
issues, the Yalin transport equation was chosen as it can handle particle differentiation
(Govers equation can still be used if wflow\_sediment is used to only model inland processes
with no particle differentiation). For land cells, wflow\_sediment assumes that erosion can
mobilize 5 classes of sediment:

- Clay (mean diameter of $\SI{2}{\mu m}$)
- Silt (mean diameter of $\SI{10}{\mu m}$)
- Sand (mean diameter of $\SI{200}{\mu m}$)
- Small aggregates (mean diameter of $\SI{30}{\mu m}$)
- Large aggregates (mean diameter of $\SI{50}{\mu m}$).

\begin{gathered}
   \mathrm{PSA} = \mathrm{SAN} (1-\mathrm{CLA})^{2.4} \\
   \mathrm{PSI} = 0.13\mathrm{SIL}\\
   \mathrm{PCL} = 0.20\mathrm{CLA} \\

   \mathrm{SAG} =
   \begin{align*}
      \begin{cases}
         2.0\mathrm{CLA} &\text{ if }\quad \mathrm{CLA} < 0.25 \\
         0.28(\mathrm{CLA}-0.25)+0.5 &\text{ if }\quad 0.25 \leq \mathrm{CLA} \leq 0.5 \\
         0.57 &\text{ if }\quad \mathrm{CLA} > 0.5
      \end{cases}
   \end{align*} \\

   \mathrm{LAG} = 1 - \mathrm{PSA} - \mathrm{PSI} - \mathrm{PCL} - \mathrm{SAG}
\end{gathered}

where $\mathrm{CLA}$, $\mathrm{SIL}$ and $\mathrm{SAN}$ are the primary clay, silt, sand
fractions of the topsoil and $\mathrm{PCL}$, $\mathrm{PSI}$, $\mathrm{PSA}$, $\mathrm{SAG}$
and $\mathrm{LAG}$ are the clay, silt, sand, small and large aggregates fractions of the
detached sediment respectively. The transport capacity of the flow using Yalin's equation
with particle differentiation, developed by Foster (1982), is:

$$
   \mathrm{TC}_i = (P_e)_i  (S_g)_i \, \rho_w \,  g \, d_i  V_*
$$

where $\mathrm{TC}_i$ is the transport capacity of the flow for the particle class $i$,
$(P_e)_i$ is the effective number of particles of class $i$, $\SIb{(S_g)_i}{kg\ m^{-3}}$ is
the specific gravity for the particle class $i$, $\SIb{\rho_w}{kg\ m^{-3}}$ is the mass
density of the fluid, $\SIb{g}{m\ s^{-2}}$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
$\SIb{d_i}{m}$ is the diameter of the particle of class $i$ and $V_* = \SIb{(g R
S)^{0.5}}{m\ s^{-1}}$ is the shear velocity of the flow with $S$ the slope gradient and
$\SIb{R}{m}$ the hydraulic radius of the flow. The detached sediment are then routed down
slope until the river network using the `accucapacityflux`, `accupacitystate` functions
depending on the transport capacity from Yalin.

The choice of transport capacity method for the overland flow is set up in the model section of
the TOML:

```toml
[model]
land_transport = "yalinpart" # Overland flow transport capacity method: ["yalinpart", "govers", "yalin"]
```

Note that the "govers" and "yalin" equations can only assess total transport capacity of the
flow and can therefore not be used in combination with the river part of the sediment model.

## River Sediment Model

Sediment dynamics in rivers can be described by the same three processes on land: erosion,
deposition and transport. The difference is that channel ﬂow is much higher, deeper and
permanent compared to overland ﬂow. In channels, erosion is the direct removal of sediments
from the river bed or bank (lateral erosion). Sediments are transported in the river either
by rolling, sliding and silting (bed load transport) or via turbulent flow in the higher
water column (suspended load transport). The type of transport is determined by the river
bed shear stress. As sediment particles have a higher density than water, they can also be
deposited on the river bed according to their settling velocity compared to the ﬂow
velocity. In addition to regular deposition in the river, lakes, reservoirs and floodplains
represents additional major sediment settling pools.

Complete models of sediment dynamics based on hydrology and not on hydraulics or
hydrodynamics are much rarer than for soil loss and inland dynamics. The simpler models such
as the SWAT default sediment river model uses again the transport capacity of the ﬂow to
determine if there is erosion or deposition (Neitsch et al., 2011).  A more physics-based
approach (Partheniades, 1965) to determine river erosion is used by Liu et al. (2018) and in
the new SWAT's approach developed by Narasimhan et al. (2017). For wﬂow\_sediment, the new
physics-based model of SWAT was chosen for transport and erosion as it enables the use of
parameter estimation for erosion of bed and bank of the channel and separates the suspended
from the bed loads.

Running the river model is an option of the wflow\_sediment model and is enabled using the TOML
file. By default it is `false`:
```toml
[model]
run_river_model = true
```

### Sediment inputs in a river cell
The first part of the river model assesses how much detached sediment are in the river cell
at the beginning of the timestep $t$. Sources of detached sediment are sediments coming from
land erosion, estimated with the soil loss part of wflow_sediment model, the sediment coming
from upstream river cells and the detached sediment that were left in the cell at the end of
the previous timestep $(t-1)$:

$$
   (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{in})_t = (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{land})_t + \mathrm{upstream}\left[(\subtext{\text{sed}}{out})_{t-1}\right] + (\subtext{\text{sed}}{riv})_{t-1}
$$

### River transport and erosion
Once the amount of sediment inputs at the beginning of the timestep is known, the model then
estimates transport, and river erosion if there is a deficit of sediments. Transport in the
river system is estimated via a transport capacity formula. There are several transport
capacity formulas available in wflow_sediment, some requiring calibration and some not.
Choosing a transport capacity equation depends on the river characteristics (some equation
are more suited for narrow or wider rivers), and on the reliability of the required river
parameters (such as slope, width or mean particle diameter of the river channel). Several
river transport capacity are available and the choice is set up in the model section of the
TOML:

```toml
[model]
river_transport = "bagnold" # River flow transport capacity method: ["bagnold", "engelund", "yang", "kodatie", "molinas"]
```

**Simplified Bagnold**

Originally more valid for intermediate to large rivers, this simplified version of the
Bagnold equation relates sediment transport to flow velocity with two simple calibration
parameters (Neitsch et al, 2011):

$$
C_{\max} = \subtext{c}{sp}  \left( \dfrac{\mathrm{prf} Q}{h W} \right)^{\subtext{\mathrm{sp}}{exp}}
$$

where $\SIb{C_{\max}}{kg\ L^{-1}}$ (or $\SIb{}{ton\ m^{-1}}$) is the sediment concentration,
$\SIb{Q}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ is the surface runoff in the river cell, $\SIb{h}{m}$ is the river
water level, $\SIb{W}{m}$ is the river width and $\subtext{c}{sp}$, $\mathrm{prf}$ and
$\subtext{\mathrm{sp}}{exp}$ are calibration parameters. The $\mathrm{prf}$ coefficient is
usually used to deduce the peak velocity of the flow, but for simplification in
`wflow_sediment`, the equation was simplified to only get two parameters to calibrate:
$\subtext{\mathrm{sp}}{exp}$ and $\subtext{c}{Bagnold} = \subtext{c}{sp} \,
\mathrm{prf}^{\subtext{\mathrm{sp}}{exp}}$. The coefficient $\subtext{\mathrm{sp}}{exp}$
usually varies between $1$ and $2$ while $\mathrm{prf}$ and $\subtext{c}{sp}$ have a wider
range of variation. The table below summarizes ranges and values of the three Bagnold
coefficients used by other studies:

Table: Range of the simplified Bagnold coefficients (and calibrated value)

| Study | River | $\mathrm{prf}$ range | $\subtext{c}{sp}$ range | $\subtext{\mathrm{sp}}{exp}$ range |
|:----- | ----- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Vigiak 2015 | Danube | 0.5-2 (/) | 0.0001-0.01 (0.003-0.006) | 1-2 (1.4) |
| Vigiak 2017 | Danube | / | 0.0001-0.01 (0.0015) | 1-2 (1.4) |
| Abbaspour 2007 | Thur (CH) | 0.2-0.25 (/) | 0.001-0.002 (/) | 0.35-1.47 (/) |
| Oeurng 2011 | Save (FR) | 0-2 (0.58) | 0.0001-0.01 (0.01) | 1-2 (2) |

**Engelund and Hansen** This transport capacity is not present in SWAT but used in many models
such as Delft3D-WAQ, Engelund and Hansen calculates the total sediment load as (Engelund and
Hansen, 1967):
$$
   C_w = 0.05 \left( \dfrac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{s} - \rho} \right) \left( \dfrac{u S}{\sqrt{\left( \dfrac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{s} - \rho} \right) g  D_{50}}} \right) \theta^{1/2}
$$

where $C_w$ is the sediment concentration by weight, $\SIb{\rho}{g\ m^{-3}}$ and
$\SIb{\rho_{s}}{g\ m^{-3}}$ are the fluid and sediment density (here respectively equal to
$\SI{1000}{g\ m^{-3}}$ and $\SI{2650}{g\ m^{-3}}$), $\SIb{u}{m\ s^{-1}}$ is the water mean
velocity, $S$ is the river slope, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\SIb{D_{50}}{m}$
is the river mean diameter and $\theta$ is the Shields parameter.

**Kodatie** Kodatie (1999) developed the power relationships from Posada (1995) using field
data and linear optimization so that they would be applicable for a wider range of riverbed
sediment size. The resulting equation, for a rectangular channel, is (Neitsch et al, 2011):
$$
   C_{\max} = \left( \dfrac{a u^{b} h^{c} S^{d}}{\subtext{V}{in}} \right)  W
$$
where $\SIb{\subtext{V}{in}}{m^3}$ in the volume of water entering the river cell
during the timestep and $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are coefficients depending on the riverbed
sediment size. Values of these coefficients are summarized in the table below.

Table: Range of the simplified Bagnold coefficients (and calibrated value)

| River sediment diameter | a | b | c | d |
|:------------------------|---|---|---|---|
| $D_{50} \leq \SI{0.05}{mm}$ | 281.4 | 2.622 | 0.182 | 0 |
| $\SI{0.05}{mm} < D_{50} \leq \SI{0.25}{mm}$ | 2  829.6 | 3.646 | 0.406 | 0.412 |
| $\SI{0.25}{mm} < D_{50} \leq \SI{2.0}{mm}$ | 2  123.4 | 3.300 | 0.468 | 0.613 |
| $D_{50} > \SI{2.0}{mm}$ | 431  884.8 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 2.000 |

**Yang** Yang (1996) developed a set of two equations giving transport of sediments for
sand-bed or gravel-bed rivers. The sand equation ($D_{50} < \SI{2.0}{mm}$) is:

$$
   \log\left(C_{ppm}\right) = 5.435 - 0.286\log\left(\frac{\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\nu}\right)-0.457\log\left(\frac{u_*}{\omega_{s,50}}\right) \\
   +\left(1.799-0.409\log\left(\frac{\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\nu}\right)-0.314\log\left(\frac{u_*}{\omega_{s,50}}\right)\right)\log\left(\frac{uS}{\omega_{s,50}}-\frac{u_{cr}S}{\omega_{s,50}}\right)
$$

And the gravel equation ($\SI{2.0}{mm} \leq D_{50} < \SI{10.0}{mm}$) is:

$$
   \log\left(C_{ppm}\right) = 6.681 - 0.633\log\left(\frac{\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\nu}\right)-4.816\log\left(\frac{u_*}{\omega_{s,50}}\right) \\
   +\left(2.784-0.305\log\left(\frac{\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\nu}\right)-0.282\log\left(\frac{u_*}{\omega_{s,50}}\right)\right)\log\left(\frac{uS}{\omega_{s,50}}-\frac{u_{cr}S}{\omega_{s,50}}\right)
$$

where $C_{ppm}$ is sediment concentration in parts per million by weight,
$\SIb{\omega_{s,50}}{m\ s^{-1}}$ is the settling velocity of a particle with the median
riverbed diameter estimated with Stokes, $\SIb{\nu}{m^2\ s^{-1}}$ is the kinematic viscosity
of the fluid, $\SIb{u_*}{m\ s^{-1}}$ is the shear velocity where $u_* = \sqrt{gR_{H}S}$ with
$R_{H}$ the hydraulic radius of the river and $\SIb{u_{cr}}{m\ s^{-1}}$ is the critical
velocity (equation can be found in Hessel, 2007).

**Molinas and Wu** The Molinas and Wu (2001) transport equation was developed for large
sand-bed rivers based on the universal stream power $\psi$. The corresponding equation is
(Neitsch et al, 2011):

$$
   C_{w} = \dfrac{1430 (0.86+\sqrt{\psi}) \psi^{1.5}}{0.016+\psi} 10^{-6}
$$

where $\psi$ is the universal stream power given by:

$$
   \psi = \dfrac{\psi^{3}}{\left(\dfrac{\rho_{s}}{\rho}-1\right) g h \omega_{s,50}  \left[ \log_{10}\left(\dfrac{h}{D_{50}}\right)\right]^{2}}
$$

Once the maximum concentration $C_{\max}$ is established with one of the above transport
formula, the model then determines if there is erosion of the river bed and bank. In order
to do that, the difference $sed_{ex}$ between the maximum amount of sediment estimated with
transport ($\mathrm{sed}_{\max} = C_{\max} \subtext{V}{in}$) and the sediment inputs to the
river cell ($\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{in}$ calculated above) is calculated. If too much
sediment is coming in and $\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{ex}$ is negative, then there is no river
bed and bank erosion. And if the river has not reach its maximum transport capacity, then
erosion of the river happens.

First, the sediments stored in the cell from deposition in previous timesteps
$\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{stor}$ are eroded from clay to gravel. If this amount is not enough
to cover $\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{ex}$, then erosion of the local river bed and bank material
starts.

Instead of just setting river erosion amount to just cover the remaining difference
$\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{exeff}$ between $\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{ex}$ and
$\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{stor}$, actual erosion potential is adjusted using river
characteristics and is separated between the bed and bank of the river using the
physics-based approach of Knight (1984).

The bed and bank of the river are supposed to only be able to erode a maximum amount of
their material $E_{R,\mathrm{bed}}$ for the bed and $E_{R,\mathrm{bank}}$ for the river
bank. For a rectangular channel, assuming it is meandering and thus only one bank is prone
to erosion, they are calculated from the equations (Neitsch et al, 2011):

$$
\begin{gathered}
   E_{R,\mathrm{bed}} = k_{d,\mathrm{bed}} \left( \tau_{e,\mathrm{bed}} - \tau_{cr,\mathrm{bed}} \right) 10^{-6}  L  W  \rho_{b, \mathrm{bed}}  \Delta t \\
   E_{R,\mathrm{bank}} = k_{d,\mathrm{bank}} \left( \tau_{e,\mathrm{bank}} - \tau_{cr,\mathrm{bank}} \right) 10^{-6} L h \rho_{b, \mathrm{bank}}  \Delta t
\end{gathered}
$$

where $\SIb{E_R}{ton}$ is the potential bed/bank erosion rates, $\SIb{k_d}{cm^3\ N^{-1}\
s^{-1}}$ is the erodibility of the bed/bank material, $\SIb{\tau_e}{N\ m^{-2}}$ is the
effective shear stress from the flow on the bed/bank, $\SIb{\tau_{cr}}{N\ m^{-2}}$ is the
critical shear stress for erosion to happen, $\SIb{L}{m}$, $\SIb{W}{m}$ and $\SIb{h}{m}$ are
the channel length, width and water height, $\SIb{\rho_{b}}{g\ cm^{-3}}$ is the bulk density
of the bed/bank of the river and $\SIb{\Delta t}{s}$ is the model timestep.

In wflow_sediment, the erodibility of the bed/bank are approximated using the formula from
Hanson and Simon (2001):

$$
   k_d=0.2 \tau_{cr}^{-0.5}
$$

Normally erodibilities are evaluated using jet test in the field and there are several
reviews and some adjustments possible to this equation (Simon et al, 2011). However, to
avoid too heavy calibration and for the scale considered, this equation is supposed to be
efficient enough. The critical shear stress $\tau_{cr}$ is evaluated differently for the bed
and bank. For the bed, the most common formula from Shields initiation of movement is used.
For the bank, a more recent approach from Julian and Torres (2006) is used:

$$
   \tau_{cr,\mathrm{bank}} = (0.1+0.1779 SC+0.0028 SC^{2}-2.34 10^{-5}  SC^{3}) C_{ch}
$$

where $SC$ is the percent clay and silt content of the river bank and $C_{ch}$ is a
coefficient taking into account the positive impact of vegetation on erosion reduction. This
coefficient is then dependent on the land use and classical values are shown in the table
below. These values where then adapted for use with the GlobCover land use map. Percent of
clay and silt (along with sand and gravel) for the channel is estimated from the river
median particle diameter assuming the same values as SWAT shown in the table below. Median
particle diameter is here estimated depending on the Strahler river order. The higher the
order, the smaller the diameter is. As the median diameter is only used in wflow_sediment
for the estimation of the river bed/bank sediment composition, this supposition should be
enough. Actual refined data or calibration may however be needed if the median diameter is
also required for the transport formula. In a similar way, the bulk densities of river bed
and bank are also just assumed to be of respectively $\SI{1.5}{g\ cm^{-3}}$ and $\SI{1.4}{g\
cm^{-3}}$.

Table: Classical values of the channel cover vegetation coefficient (Julian and Torres, 2006)

| Bank vegetation | $C_{ch}$ |
|:---- | ---- |
| None | 1.00 |
| Grassy | 1.97 |
| Sparse trees | 5.40 |
| Dense trees | 19.20 |

Table: Composition of the river bed/bank depending on the median diameter $\SIb{d_{50}}{\mu m}$
(Neitsch et al, 2011)

|Sediment Fraction   | $\leq$ 5 | 5 to 50 | 50 to 2000 | $>$ 2000 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Sand | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.65 | 0.15 |
| Silt | 0.15 | 0.65 | 0.15 | 0.15 |
| Clay | 0.65 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.05 |
| Gravel | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.65 |

Then, the repartition of the flow shear stress is refined into the effective shear stress
and the bed and bank of the river using the equations developed by Knight (1984) for a
rectangular channel:

$$
\begin{gathered}
   \tau_{e,\mathrm{bed}} = \rho g R_{H} S  \left(1 - \dfrac{SF_{\mathrm{bank}}}{100}\right) \left(1+\dfrac{2h}{W}\right) \\
   \tau_{e,\mathrm{bank}} = \rho g R_{H} S  \left( SF_{\mathrm{bank}}\right)  \left(1+\dfrac{W}{2h}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

where $\rho g$ is the fluid specific weight ($\SI{9800}{N\ m^{-3}}$ for water),
$\SIb{R_H}{m}$ is the hydraulic radius of the channel, $\SIb{h}{m}$ and $\SIb{W}{m}$ are the
water level and river width. $SF_{\mathrm{bank}}$ is the proportion of shear stress acting
on the bank (%) and is estimated from (Knight, 1984):

$$
   \mathrm{SF}_{\mathrm{bank}} = \exp \left( -3.230 \log_{10}\left(\dfrac{W}{h}+3\right)+6.146 \right)
$$

Finally the relative erosion potential of the bank and bed of the river is calculated by:

$$
\begin{gathered}
   \mathrm{RTE}_{\mathrm{bed}} = \dfrac{E_{R,\mathrm{bed}}}{E_{R,\mathrm{bed}}+E_{R,\mathrm{bank}}} \\
   \mathrm{RTE}_{\mathrm{bank}} = 1 - RTE_{\mathrm{bed}}
\end{gathered}
$$

And the final actual eroded amount for the bed and bank is the maximum between $\mathrm{RTE}
\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{exeff}$ and the erosion potential $E_R$. Total eroded amount of
sediment $\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{erod}$ is then the sum of the eroded sediment coming from
the storage of previously deposited sediment and the river bed/bank erosion.

### River deposition
As sediments have a higher density than water, moving sediments in water can be deposited in
the river bed. The deposition process depends on the mass of the sediment, but also on flow
characteristics such as velocity. In wflow_sediment, as in SWAT, deposition is modelled with
Einstein's equation (Neitsch et al, 2011):

$$
   \subtext{P}{dep}=\left(1-\dfrac{1}{e^{x}}\right)100
$$

where $\subtext{P}{dep}$ is the percentage of sediments that is deposited on the river bed and
x is a parameter calculated with:

$$
   x = \dfrac{1.055 L  \omega_{s}}{u h}
$$

where $\SIb{L}{m}$ and $\SIb{h}{m}$ are channel length and water height, $\SIb{\omega_s}{m\
s^{-1}}$ is the particle settling velocity calculated with Stokes' formula and $\SIb{u}{m\
s^{-1}}$ is the mean flow velocity. The calculated percentage is then subtracted from the
amount of sediment input and eroded river sediment for each particle size class
($\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{dep} = \subtext{P}{dep}/100 (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{in} +
\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{erod})$). Resulting deposited sediment are then stored in the river
bed and can be re-mobilized in future time steps by erosion.

### Mass balance and sediment concentration
Finally after estimating inputs, deposition and erosion with the transport capacity of the
flow, the amount of sediment actually leaving the river cell to go downstream is estimated
using:

$$
   \subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{out} = (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{in} + \subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{erod} - \subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{dep}) \dfrac{\subtext{V}{out}}{V}
$$

where $\SIb{\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{out}}{ton}$ is the amount of sediment leaving the river
cell (tons), $\SIb{\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{in}}{ton}$ is the amount of sediment coming into
the river cell (storage from previous timestep, land erosion and sediment flux from upstream
river cells), $\SIb{\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{erod}}{ton}$ is the amount of sediment coming
from river erosion, $\SIb{\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{dep}}{ton}$ is the amount of deposited
sediments, $\SIb{\subtext{V}{out}}{m^3}$ is the volume of water leaving the river cell
(surface runoff $Q$ times timestep $\Delta t$) and $\SIb{V}{m^3}$ is the total volume of
water in the river cell ($\subtext{V}{out}$ plus storage $h W L$).

A mass balance is then used to calculate the amount of sediment remaining in the cell at the
end of the timestep $(\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{riv})_t$:

$$
   (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{riv})_t = (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{riv})_{t-1} + (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{land})_t + \mathrm{upstream}\left[(\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{out})_{t-1}\right] + (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{erod})_t - (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{dep})_t - (\subtext{\mathrm{sed}}{out})_t
$$

### Lake and reservoir modelling
Apart from land and river, the hydrological `wflow_sbm` model also handles lakes and
reservoirs modelling. In `wflow_sbm`, lakes and large reservoirs are modelled using a 1D
bucket model at the cell corresponding to the outlet. For the other cells belonging to the
lake/reservoir which are not the outlet, processes such as precipitation and evaporation are
filtered out and shifted to the outlet cell. `wflow_sediment` handles the lakes and
reservoirs in the same way. If a cell belongs to a lake/reservoir and is not the outlet then
the model assumes that no erosion/deposition of sediments is happening and the sediments are
only all transported to the lake/reservoir outlet. Once the sediments reach the outlet, then
sediments are deposited in the lake/reservoir according to Camp's model (1945) (Verstraeten
et al, 2000):

$$
   \mathrm{TE} = \dfrac{\omega_s}{u_{cr,\mathrm{res}}} = \dfrac{\subtext{A}{res}}{\subtext{Q}{out,res}} \omega_s
$$

where $\mathrm{TE}$ is the trapping efficiency of the lake/reservoir (or the fraction of
particles trapped), $\SIb{\omega_{s}}{m\ s^{-1}}$ is the particle velocity from Stokes,
$\SIb{\subtext{u}{cr,res}}{m\ s^{-1}}$ is the reservoir's critical settling velocity which
is equal to the reservoir's outflow $\SIb{\subtext{Q}{out,res}}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ divided by the
reservoir's surface area $\SIb{\subtext{A}{res}}{m^2}$.

For reservoirs, coarse sediment particles from the bed load are also assumed to be trapped
by the dam structure. This adding trapping is taken into account with a reservoir trapping
efficiency coefficient for large particles (between $0$ and $1$). Depending on the type of
the dam, all bed load particles are trapped (`restrapefficiency = 1.0`, for example for a
gravity dam) or only partly (for example for run-of-the-river dams).

Lake and reservoir modelling is enabled in the model section of the TOML and require the extra
following input arguments:

```toml
[model]
reservoirs = true
lakes = true

[input]
# Reservoir
reservoir_area__count = "wflow_reservoirareas"
reservoir_location__count = "wflow_reservoirlocs"
# Lake
lake_area__count = "wflow_lakeareas"
lake_location__count = "wflow_lakelocs" 

[input.static]
# Reservoir
reservoir_surface__area = "ResSimpleArea"
restrapefficiency = "ResTrapEff"
# Lake
lake_surface__area = "LakeArea"
```

Note that in the inland part, lake and reservoir coverage are used to filter erosion and
transport in overland flow.
