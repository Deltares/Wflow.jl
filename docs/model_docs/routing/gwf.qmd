title: Groundwater flow
---

Single layer groundwater flow requires the four following components, and each is described in
more detail below:

+ aquifer
+ connectivity
+ constanthead
+ boundaries

## Aquifer types
Groundwater flow can occur either in a confined or unconfined aquifer. Confined aquifers are
overlain by a poorly permeable confining layer (e.g. clay). No air can get in to fill the pore
space so that the aquifer always remains fully saturated. For a confined aquifer, water will
always flow along the complete height $\SIb{H}{m}$ over the aquifer and transmissivity
$\SIb{kH}{m^2 d^{-1}}$ is a constant ($\SIb{k}{m d^{-1}}$ is the horizontal hydraulic
conductivity). Specific storage is the amount of water an aquifer releases per unit change in
hydraulic head, per unit volume of aquifer, as the aquifer and the groundwater itself is
compressed. Its value is much smaller than specific yield, between $10^{-5}$ (stiff) and
$10^{-2}$ (weak).

The upper boundary of an unconfined aquifer is the water table (the phreatic surface). Specific
yield (or drainable porosity) represents the volumetric fraction the aquifer will yield when
all water drains and the pore volume is filled by air instead. Specific yield will vary roughly
between $0.05$ (clay) and $0.45$ (peat) (Johnson, 1967).

Groundwater flow is solved forward in time and central in space. The vertically averaged
governing equation for an inhomogeneous and isotropic aquifer in one dimension can be written
as:

$$
    S \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} =  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(kH \frac{\phi}{\delta x}\right) + Q
$$

where $\SIb{S}{m m^{-1}}$ is storativity (or specific yield), $\SIb{\phi}{m}$ is hydraulic
head, $t$ is time, $\SIb{k}{m t^{-1}}$ is horizontal hydraulic conductivity, $\SIb{H}{m}$ is
the (saturated) aquifer height: groundwater level - aquifer bottom elevation and $\SIb{Q}{m
t^{-1}}$ represents fluxes from boundary conditions (e.g. recharge or abstraction), see also
[Aquifer boundary conditions](#aquifer-boundary-conditions).

The simplest finite difference formulation is forward in time, central in space, and can be
written as:

$$
    S_i  \frac{\phi_{i}^{t+1} - \phi_i^{t}}{\Delta t} = -C_{i-1}  (\phi_{i-1} - \phi_i) - C_i  (\phi_{i+1} - \phi_i) + Q_i
$$

where $i$ is the cell index, $t$ is time, $\Delta t$ is the step size, $C_{i-1}$ is the the
intercell conductance between cell $i-1$ and $i$ and $C_i$ is the intercell conductance between
cell $i$ and $i+1$. The connection data between cells is stored as part of the `Connectivity`
struct, see also [Connectivity](#connectivity) for more information.

Conductance $C$ is defined as:

$$
C = \frac{kH w}{l}
$$

where $\SIb{w}{m}$ is the width of the cell to cell connection, and $\SIb{l}{m}$ is the length
of the cell to cell connection. $k$ and $H$ may both vary in space; intercell conductance is
therefore an average using the properties of two cells.  For the calculation of the intercell
conductance $C$ the harmonic mean is used (see also Goode and Appel, 1992), here between cell
index $i$ and cell index $i+1$, in the $x$ direction:

$$
    C_i = w  \frac{k_iH_i\cdot k_{i+1}H_{i+1}}{k_iH_i \cdot l_{i+1} + k_{i+1}H_{i+1} \cdot l_i}
$$

where $\SIb{H}{m}$ is the aquifer top - aquifer bottom, and $k$, $l_i$ is the length in cell
$i$ ($0.5 \Delta x_i$),  $l_{i+1}$ is the length in cell $i+1$ ($0.5 \Delta x_{i+1}$) and $w$
as previously defined. For an unconfined aquifer the intercell conductance is scaled by using
the "upstream saturated fraction" as the MODFLOW documentation calls it. In this approach, the
saturated thickness of a cell-to-cell is approximated using the cell with the highest head.
This results in a consistent overestimation of the saturated thickness, but it avoids
complexities related with cell drying and rewetting, such as having to define a "wetting
threshold" or a "wetting factor". See also the documentation for MODFLOW-NWT (Niswonger et al.,
1)    or MODFLOW6 (Langevin et al., 2017) for more background information. For more background
on drying and rewetting, see for example McDonald et al. (1991).

For the finite difference formulation, there is only one unknown, $\phi_i^{t+1}$. Reshuffling
terms:

$$
\phi_i^{t+1} = \phi_i^t + (C_{i-1}  (\phi_i - \phi_{i-1}) + C_i  (\phi_{i+1} - \phi_i) + Q_i) \frac{Δt}{S_i}
$$

This can be generalized to two dimensions, for both regular and irregular cell connectivity.
Finally, a stable time step size can be computed given the forward-in-time, central in space
scheme, based on the following criterion from Chu and Willis (1984):

$$
  \frac{\Delta t k H}{\Delta x  \Delta y S}  \le \frac{1}{4}
$$

where $\SIb{\Delta t}{d}$ is the stable time step size, $\SIb{\Delta x}{m}$ is the cell length
in the $x$ direction and $\SIb{\Delta y}{m}$ is the cell length in the $y$ direction,
$\SIb{k}{m^2 d^{-1}}$ is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and $\SIb{H}{m}$ is the
saturated thickness of the aquifer. For each cell $\frac{\Delta x  \Delta y S}{k H}$ is
calculated, the minimum of these values is determined, and multiplied by $\frac{1}{4}$, to get
the stable time step size.

For more details about the finite difference formulation and the stable time step size
criterion we refer to the paper of Chu and Willis (1984).

Boundary conditions can be classified into three categories:

+ specified head (Dirichlet)
+ specified flux (Neumann)
+ head-dependent flux (Robin)

Neumann and Robin conditions are implemented by adding to or subtracting from a net (lumped)
cell flux. Dirichlet conditions are special cased, since they cannot (easily) be implemented
via the flux, but the head is set directly instead.

## Connectivity
The connectivity between cells is defined as follows.

```@docs
Wflow.Connectivity
```


## Constant head
Dirichlet boundary conditions can be specified through the field `constanthead` (type
`ConstantHead`)  of the `GroundwaterFlow` struct.

```julia
@get_units struct ConstantHead{T}
    head::Vector{T} | "m"
    index::Vector{Int} | "-"
end
```

For the model `SBM + Groundwater flow` this boundary condition is optional, and if used should
be specified in the TOML file as follows (see also
[sbm\_gwf\_config.toml](https://github.com/Deltares/Wflow.jl/blob/master/test/sbm_gwf_config.toml)):

```toml
[model]
constanthead = true
```

## Aquifer boundary conditions

### River
The flux between river and aquifer is calculated using Darcy's law following the approach in
MODFLOW:

$$
  \subtext{Q}{riv} =
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{cases}
      C_i \min \left\{\subtext{h}{riv} - \subtext{B}{riv}, \subtext{h}{riv} - \phi\right\} &\text{ if }\quad \subtext{h}{riv} > \phi \\
      C_e (\subtext{h}{riv} - \phi) &\text{ if }\quad \subtext{h}{riv} \le \phi
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
$$

where $\SIb{\subtext{Q}{riv}}{L^3 T^{-1}}$ is the exchange flux from river to aquifer,
$\SIb{C_i}{L^2 T^{-1}}$ is the river bed infiltration conductance, $\SIb{C_e}{L^2 T^{-1}}$ is
the river bed exfiltration conductance, $\SIb{\subtext{B}{riv}}{L}$ the bottom of the river
bed, $\SIb{\subtext{h}{riv}}{L}$ is the river stage and $\SIb{\phi}{L}$ is the hydraulic head
in the river cell.

The Table in the Groundwater flow [river boundary condition](../parameters_routing.qmd#river)
section of the Model parameters provides the parameters of the struct `River`. Parameters that
can be set directly from the static input data (netCDF) are marked in this Table.

The exchange flux (river to aquifer) $\subtext{Q}{riv}$ is an output variable (field `flux` of
the `River` struct), and is used to update the total flux in a river cell. For the model `SBM +
Groundwater flow`, the water level $\SIb{h}{m}$ of the river kinematic wave in combination with
the river `bottom` is used to update the `stage` field of the `River` struct each time step.

### Drainage
The flux from drains to the aquifer is calculated as follows:

$$
\subtext{Q}{drain} = \subtext{C}{drain} \min(0, \subtext{h}{drain} - \phi)
$$

where $\SIb{\subtext{Q}{drain}}{L^3 T^{-1}}$ is the exchange flux from drains to aquifer,
$\SIb{\subtext{C}{drain}}{L^2 T^{-1}}$ is the drain conductance, $\SIb{\subtext{h}{drain}}{L}$
is the drain elevation and $\SIb{\phi}{L}$ is the hydraulic head in the cell with drainage.

The table in the Groundwater flow [drainage boundary
condition](../parameters_routing.qmd#drainage) section of the Model parameters provides the
parameters of the struct `Drainage`. Parameters that can be set directly from the static input
data (netCDF) are marked in this Table.

The exchange flux (drains to aquifer) $\subtext{Q}{drain}$ is an output variable (field `flux`
of struct `Drainage`), and is used to update the total flux in a cell with drains. For the
model `SBM + Groundwater flow` this boundary condition is optional, and if used should be
specified in the TOML file as follows (see also
[sbm\_gwf\_config.toml](https://github.com/Deltares/Wflow.jl/blob/master/test/sbm_gwf_config.toml)):

```toml
[model]
drains = true
```

### Recharge
The recharge flux $Q_r$ to the aquifer is calculated as follows:

$$
Q_r = R \, A
$$

with $\SIb{}{L T^{-1}}$ the recharge rate and $\SIb{A}{L^2}$ the area of the aquifer cell.

The table in the Groundwater flow [recharge boundary
condition](../parameters_routing.qmd#recharge) section of the Model parameters section provides
the parameters of the struct `Recharge`. Parameters that can be set directly from the static
input data (netCDF) are marked in this Table.

The recharge flux $Q_r$ is an output variable (field `flux` of struct `Recharge`), and is used
to update the total flux in a cell where recharge occurs. For the model `SBM + Groundwater
flow`, the recharge rate from the vertical SBM concept `recharge` [mm] is used to update the
`rate` field of the `Recharge` struct each time step. The `rate` field is multiplied by the
`area` field of the aquifer.

### Head boundary
This boundary is a fixed head with time (not affected by the model stresses over time) outside
of the model domain, and is generally used to avoid an unnecessary extension of the model
domain to the location of the fixed boundary (for example a large lake). The flux from the
boundary $\SIb{Q_{hb}}{L^3 T^{-1}}$ is calculated as follows:

$$
Q_{hb} = C_{hb} (\phi_{hb} - \phi)
$$

with $\SIb{C_{hb}}{L^2 T^{-1}}$ the conductance of the head boundary, $\SIb{\phi_{hb}}{L}$ the
head of the head boundary and $\phi$ the head of the aquifer cell.

The table in the Groundwater flow [head boundary
condition](../parameters_routing.qmd#head-boundary) section of the Model parameters provides
the parameters of the struct `HeadBoundary`.

The head boundary flux $Q_{hb}$ is an output variable (field `flux` of struct `HeadBoundary`),
and is used to update the total flux in a cell where this type of boundary occurs. The
parameter Head $\phi_{hb}$ can be specified as a fixed or time dependent value.

::: {.callout-note}
This boundary is not (yet) part of the model `SBM + Groundwater flow`.
:::

### Well boundary
A volumetric well rate $\SIb{}{L^3 T^{-1}}$ can be specified as a boundary condition.

The Table in the [well boundary condition](../parameters_routing.qmd#well-boundary) section of
the Model parameters provides the parameters of the struct `Well`.

The volumetric well rate $\subtext{Q}{well}$ can be can be specified as a fixed or time
dependent value. If a cell is dry, the actual well flux `flux` is set to zero (see also the
last note on this page).

::: {.callout-note}
This boundary is not (yet) part of the model `SBM + Groundwater flow`.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
For an unconfined aquifer the boundary fluxes are checked, in case of a dry aquifer cell a
negative flux is not allowed.
