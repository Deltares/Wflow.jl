## Surface routing
The main flow routing scheme available in wflow is the kinematic wave approach for river and
overland flow, assuming that water flow is mostly controlled by topography. The kinematic
wave equations are (Chow, 1988):

$$
\begin{gathered}
  \dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x} + \dfrac{\partial A}{\partial t} = \subtext{q}{inflow},\\
   A = \alpha Q^{\beta}.
\end{gathered}
$$

These equations can then be combined as a function of flow only:

$$
    \dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x} + \alpha \beta Q^{\beta - 1} \dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial t} = \subtext{q}{inflow},
$$

where $\SIb{Q}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ is the surface flow in the kinematic wave, $\SIb{x}{m}$ is the
length of the flow pathway, $\SIb{A}{m^2}$ is the cross-section area of the flow pathway,
$\SIb{\subtext{q}{inflow}}{m^2\ s^{-1}}$ is the lateral inflow per unit length into the
kinematic wave, $\SIb{t}{s}$ is the integration timestep and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
coefficients. These coefficients can be determined by using Manning's equation (Chow, 1988),
resulting in:

$$
  \alpha = \left(\frac{n P_\mathrm{w}^{\frac{2}{3}}}{\sqrt{c_\mathrm{slope}}}\right)^\beta \ \text{and} \ \beta = 0.6,
$$

where $\SIb{P_\mathrm{w}}{m}$ is the wetted perimeter, $c_\mathrm{slope}$ 
($c_\mathrm{land\ slope}$ for overland flow and $c_\mathrm{river\ slope}$ for river flow) is
the slope $\SIb{}{m\ m^{-1}}$, and $n$ ($n_\mathrm{land}$ for overland flow and
$n_\mathrm{river}$ for river flow) is Manning's coefficient $\SIb{}{s\ m^{-\frac{1}{3}}}$.
The wetted perimeter $\subtext{P}{w}$ for river flow is calculated by adding the river width
($\subtext{w}{river}$) and 2 times half of the river bankfull depth
($\subtext{h}{bankfull}$). A bankfull river depth map (default value is $\SI{1}{m}$) for the
river can be provided as follows in the TOML configuration file:

```toml
[input.static]
river_bank_water__depth = "riverdepth"
```

For overland flow, $\subtext{P}{w}$ is set equal to the effective flow width, determined by
dividing the grid cell area by the flow length and subtracting $\subtext{w}{river}$.

The kinematic wave equations are solved with a nonlinear scheme using Newton's method. By
default, the iterations are performed until a stable solution is reached ($\epsilon <
10^{-12}$). Variable internal time stepping is based on the Courant number or a fixed time
step size $\SIb{}{s}$. To enable a fixed or variable internal time step for the kinematic
wave the following lines can be inserted in the TOML file of the model:

```toml
[model]
# Enable internal time stepping for the kinematic wave
kin_wave_iteration = true
# Fixed internal timestep for river flow (river cells)
kw_river_tstep = 900
# Fixed internal timestep for overland flow (land cells)
kw_land_tstep = 3600
```

[Reservoir and lake](./waterbodies.qmd) models can be included as part of the river
kinematic wave network.

## External inflows
External inflows $\SIb{}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ for example water supply or abstractions can be added
to the kinematic wave for river flow routing, as a cyclic parameter or as part of forcing.
For example, cyclic inflow can be provided in the TOML file as follows:

```toml
[input.cyclic]
"river_water_inflow~external__volume_flow_rate" = "river_inflow"
```
These inflows are added or subtracted from the upstream inflow before running the kinematic
wave to solve the impact on resulting river flow $\SIb{Q}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$. In case of an
abstraction (negative inflow), the abstraction is limited by a fixed scaling factor of
$0.80$ applied to sum of upstream inflow, lateral inflow and river storage, all terms
expresssed in unit $\SI{}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$.

## Abstractions
Internal abstractions $\SIb{}{m^3\ s^{-1}}$ from the river are possible when water demand and
allocation is computed. The abstraction is set from the water demand and allocation module
each time step. The abstraction is divided by the flow length of the river and subtracted
from the lateral inflow of the kinematic wave routing scheme for river flow.

## Subsurface flow routing
In the wflow\_sbm model the kinematic wave approach is used to route subsurface flow
laterally by default. Different vertical hydraulic conductivity depth profiles are possible
as part of the [SBM soil model](../land/landhydrology_sbm.qmd#soil-processes) concept, and
these profiles (after unit conversion) are also used to compute lateral subsurface flow. The
following profiles (see [SBM soil model](../land/landhydrology_sbm.qmd#soil-processes) for a
detailed description) are available:

- `exponential` (default)
- `exponential_constant`
- `layered`
- `layered_exponential`

For the profiles `exponential` and `exponential_constant`, the saturated store
$\subtext{S}{sat}$ is drained laterally by saturated downslope subsurface flow for a slope
with width $\SIb{w}{m}$ according to:

$$
    \subtext{Q}{subsurface} = K_\mathrm{h0}c_\mathrm{land\ slope}w\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{f}\left(e^{-f_\mathrm{ssf, Kv} \subtext{z}{ssf,watertable}}-e^{-f_\mathrm{ssf, Kv} \subtext{z}{ssf,exp}}\right) +
    e^{-f_\mathrm{ssf, Kv} \subtext{z}{ssf, exp}}(\subtext{z}{ssf,soil}-\subtext{z}{ssf,exp}) & \text{if $\subtext{z}{ssf,watertable} < \subtext{z}{ssf,exp}$}\\
    \\
    e^{-f_\mathrm{ssf, Kv} \subtext{z}{ssf,exp}}(\subtext{z}{ssf,soil} - \subtext{z}{ssf,watertable}) & \text{if $\subtext{z}{ssf,watertable} \ge \subtext{z}{ssf,exp}$},
    \end{cases}
$$

where $\SIb{c_\mathrm{land\ slope}}{m\ m^{-1}}$ is the land slope,
$\SIb{\subtext{Q}{subsurface}}{m^3\ d^{-1}}$ is subsurface flow, 
$\SIb{K_\mathrm{h0}}{m\ d^{-1}}$ is the saturated hydraulic conductivity at the soil
surface, $\SIb{\subtext{z}{ssf, watertable}}{m}$ is the water table depth,
$\SIb{\subtext{z}{ssf,soil}}{m}$ is the soil depth, $\SIb{f_\mathrm{ssf, Kv}}{m^{-1}}$ is a
scaling parameter that controls the decrease of $K_\mathrm{h0}$ with depth and
$\SIb{\subtext{z}{ssf,exp}}{m}$ is the depth from soil surface for which the exponential decline
of $K_\mathrm{h0}$ is valid. For the `exponential` profile, $\subtext{z}{ssf,exp}$ is equal to
$\subtext{z}{ssf,soil}$.

Combining with the following continuity equation:
$$
    (\theta_s-\theta_r)w\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial \subtext{Q}{subsurface}}{\partial x} + wR
$$

where $\SIb{h}{m}$ is the water table height, $\SIb{x}{m}$ is the distance downslope,
$\SIb{R}{m\ d^{-1}}$ is the net input rate to the saturated store, $\SIb{\theta_{s}}{-}$ and
$\SIb{\theta_{r}}{-}$ are the saturated and residual soil water contents, respectively.
Substituting for $h (\frac{\partial Q}{\partial h})$, gives:

$$
  \frac{\partial \subtext{Q}{subsurface}}{\partial t} = -c\frac{\partial \subtext{Q}{subsurface}}{\partial x} + cwR
$$

where celerity $c$ is calculated as follows:
$$
    c = \frac{K_\mathrm{h0}c_\mathrm{land\ slope}}{\theta_s-\theta_r}\begin{cases}
    e^{-f_\mathrm{ssf, Kv}\subtext{z}{ssf,watertable}}
    + e^{-f_\mathrm{ssf, Kv}\subtext{z}{ssf,exp}} & \text{if $\subtext{z}{ssf,watertable} < \subtext{z}{ssf,exp}$}\\
    \\
    e^{-f_\mathrm{ssf, Kv}\subtext{z}{ssf,exp}} & \text{if $\subtext{z}{ssf,watertable} \ge \subtext{z}{ssf,exp}$}.
    \end{cases}
$$

For the `layered` and `layered_exponential` profiles the equivalent horizontal hydraulic
conductivity $\SIb{\subtext{K}{h}}{m\ d^{-1}}$ is calculated for water table height 
$\SIb{h = \subtext{z}{ssf,soil}-\subtext{z}{ssf,watertable}}{m}$ and lateral subsurface flow
is calculated as follows:

$$
  \subtext{Q}{subsurface} = \subtext{K}{h} h c_\mathrm{land\ slope} w,
$$

and celerity $c$ is given by:

$$
    c = \frac{\subtext{K}{h} c_\mathrm{land\ slope}}{\theta_s-\theta_r}.
$$

The kinematic wave equation for lateral subsurface flow is solved iteratively using Newton's
method.

::: {.callout-note}
For the lateral subsurface flow kinematic wave the model timestep is not adjusted. For certain
model timestep and model grid size combinations this may result in loss of accuracy.

## Multi-Threading
The kinematic wave calculations for surface - and subsurface flow routing can be executed in
parallel using multiple threads. In the model section of the TOML file, a minimum stream order
can be provided to define subbasins for the river (default is 6) and land domain (default is
5). Subbasins are created at all confluences where each branch has a minimal stream order.
Based on the subbasins a directed acyclic graph is created that controls the order of execution
and which subbasins can run in parallel.

```toml
[model]
min_streamorder_river = 5 # minimum stream order to delineate subbasins for river domain, default is 6
min_streamorder_land = 4  # minimum stream order to delineate subbasins for land domain, default is 5
```

## Subcatchment flow
Normally the the kinematic wave is continuous throughout the model. By using the `pits` entry
in the model and input sections of the TOML file all flow is at the subcatchment only (upstream
of the pit locations, defined by the netCDF variable `wflow_pits` in the example below) and no
flow is transferred from one subcatchment to another. This can be convenient when connecting
the result of the model to a water allocation model such as Ribasim.

```toml
[input]
# these are not directly part of the model
pits = "wflow_pits"

[model]
pits = true
```

## Limitations
The kinematic wave approach for river, overland and lateral subsurface flow, assumes that
the topography controls water flow mostly. This assumption holds for steep terrain, but in
less steep terrain the hydraulic gradient is likely not equal to the surface slope
(subsurface flow), or pressure differences and inertial momentum cannot be neglected
(channel and overland flow). In addition, while the kinematic wave equations are solved with
a nonlinear scheme using Newton's method (Chow, 1988), other model equations are solved
through a simple explicit scheme. In summary the following limitations apply:

+ River flow, and to a lesser degree overland flow, may be unrealistic in terrain that is not
  steep, and where pressure forces and inertial momentum are important.
+ The lateral movement of subsurface flow may be very wrong in terrain that is not steep.
