title: Model configurations
---

There are several model configurations supported by wflow. These model configurations
require slightly different input requirements, yet the general structure is similar for each
model. A wflow model configuration consists of a [Land hydrology
SBM](./land/landhydrology_sbm.qmd) model in combination with `routing` concepts that control
how water is routed for example over the land or river domain. For the wflow\_sbm model
different model configurations are possible. The following model configurations are
supported in wflow:

 - wflow\_sbm:
    - Land Hydrology `SBM` + kinematic wave for subsurface and surface flow
    - Land Hydrology `SBM` + kinematic wave for subsurface and overland flow + local inertial river (+
      optional floodplain)
    - Land Hydrology `SBM` + kinematic wave for subsurface flow + local inertial river (1D) and land (2D)
    - Land Hydrology `SBM` + groundwater flow + kinematic wave for surface flow
 - wflow\_sediment as post processing of wflow\_sbm output

Below, some explanation will be given on how to prepare a basic wflow\_sbm model. Example
data for other model configurations is provided in the section with [sample
data](../getting_started/download_example_models.qmd).

## wflow\_sbm

Wflow\_sbm represents hydrological models derived from the CQflow model (Köhler et al.,
2006) that have the [Land Hydrology SBM](./land/landhydrology_sbm.qmd) model concept in
common, but can have different routing concepts that control how water is routed for example
over the land or river domain. The `soil` model of the Land Hydrology `SBM` model is largely
based on the Topog\_SBM model but has had considerable changes over time. Topog\_SBM is
specifically designed to simulate fast runoff processes in small catchments while the
wflow\_sbm model can be applied more widely.

Topog\_SBM uses an element network based on contour lines and trajectories for water
routing. Wflow\_sbm models differ in how the routing components river, land, and subsurface
are solved. More details and the differences with the Topog\_SBM model can be found
[here](./land/landhydrology_sbm.qmd#Introduction). Below the different wflow\_sbm model
configurations are described, according to the used routing approach.

### Kinematic wave
Water is routed over a D8 network, and the kinematic wave approach is used for river,
overland and lateral subsurface flow. This is described in more detail in the section
[Kinematic wave](./routing/kinwave.qmd).

An overview of the different processes and fluxes in the wflow_sbm model with the kinematic
wave approach for river, overland and lateral subsurface flow:

### Groundwater flow
For river and overland flow the kinematic wave approach over a D8 network is used for this
wflow\_sbm model. For the subsurface domain, an unconfined aquifer with groundwater flow in
four directions (adjacent cells) is used. This is described in more detail in the section
[Groundwater flow](./routing/gwf.qmd).

```toml
[model]
type = "sbm_gwf"
```

### Local inertial river
By default the model types `sbm` and `sbm_gwf` use the kinematic wave approach for river flow.
There is also the option to use the local inertial model for river flow with an optional 1D
floodplain schematization (routing is done separately for the river channel and floodplain), by
providing the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
river_routing = "local_inertial"    # optional, default is "kinematic_wave"
floodplain_1d__flag = true                # optional, default is false
```

### Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D)
By default the model types `sbm` and `sbm_gwf` use the kinematic wave approach for river and
overland flow. There is also the option to use the local inertial model for 1D river and 2D
overland flow, by providing the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
river_routing = "local_inertial"
land_routing = "local_inertial"
```

The local inertial approach is described in more detail in the section [Local inertial
model](./routing/local-inertial.qmd).

## wflow\_sediment
The processes and fate of many particles and pollutants impacting water quality at the basin
level are intricately linked to the processes governing sediment dynamics. Both nutrients
such as phosphorus, carbon or other pollutants such as metals are influenced by sediment
properties in processes such as mobilization, flocculation or deposition. To better assert
and model water quality in inland systems, a better comprehension and modelling of sediment
sources and fate in the river is needed at a spatial and time scale relevant to such issues.

The wflow\_sediment model was developed to answer such issues. It is a distributed
physics-based model, based on the distributed hydrologic wflow\_sbm model. It is able to
simulate both land and in-stream processes, and relies on available global datasets,
parameter estimation and small calibration effort.

In order to model the exports of terrestrial sediment to the coast through the Land Ocean
Aquatic Continuum or LOAC (inland waters network such as streams, lakes...), two different
modelling parts were considered. The first part, called the inland sediment model, is the
modelling and estimation of soil loss and sediment yield to the river system by land
erosion, separated into vertical [Soil Erosion](./land/sediment.qmd#soil-erosion)
processes and lateral [Sediment Flux in overland
flow](./routing/sediment_flux.qmd#sediment-flux-in-overland-flow). The second part, called
the [River Sediment Model](./routing/sediment_flux.qmd#river-sediment-model) is the
transport and processes of the sediment in the river system. The two parts together
constitute the wflow\_sediment model.

Overview of the concepts of the wflow\_sediment model:

### Configuration

As sediment generation and transport processes are linked to the hydrology and water flows, the
inputs to the wflow\_sediment model come directly from a hydrological model. The required
dynamic inputs to run wflow\_sediment are:

-  Precipitation (can also come from the hydrological forcing data),
-  Land runoff (overland flow) from the kinematic wave,
-  River runoff from the kinematic wave,
-  Land water level in the kinematic wave,
-  River water level in the kinematic wave,
-  Rainfall interception by the vegetation.

These inputs can be obtained from wflow\_sbm or from other sources.

Model outputs can be saved for both the inland and the instream part of the model. Some
examples are listed below.

```toml
[output.netcdf_grid.variables]
# # Total soil erosion rate [ton/t] from rainfall (splash)
"soil_erosion__rainfall_mass_flow_rate" = "rainfall_erosion"
# Soil erosion rate by overland flow [ton/t]
"soil_erosion__overland_flow_mass_flow_rate" = "overland_flow_erosion"
# Total soil loss rate [ton/t]
soil_erosion__mass_flow_rate = "soilloss"
# Total transport capacity of overland flow [ton/t]
land_surface_water_sediment_transport_capacity__mass_flow_rate = "TCsed"

# Total sediment flux in overland flow [ton/t]
land_surface_water_sediment__mass_flow_rate = "olsed"
# Total (or per particle class) sediment yield to the river [ton/t]
"land_surface_water_sediment__to_river_mass_flow_rate" = "inlandsed"
"land_surface_water_clay__to_river_mass_flow_rate" = "inlandclay"

# Total sediment concentration in the river (suspended + bed load) [kg/m3]
river_water_sediment__mass_concentration = "Sedconc"
# Suspended load [kg/m3]
"river_water_sediment__suspended_mass_concentration" = "SSconc"
# Bed load [kg/m3]
"river_water_sediment__bedload_mass_concentration" = "Bedconc"
```
