title: Model configurations
---

There are several model configurations supported by wflow. These model configurations
require slightly different input requirements, yet the general structure is similar for each
model. A wflow model configuration consists of a `vertical` [SBM](@ref vert_sbm) concept in
combination with `lateral` concepts that control how water is routed for example over the
land or river domain. For the wflow\_sbm model different model configurations are possible.
The following model configurations are supported in wflow:

 - wflow\_sbm:
    - SBM + kinematic wave for subsurface and surface flow
    - SBM + kinematic wave for subsurface and overland flow + local inertial river (+
      optional floodplain)
    - SBM + kinematic wave for subsurface flow + local inertial river (1D) and land (2D)
    - SBM + groundwater flow + kinematic wave for surface flow
 - wflow\_sediment as post processing of wflow\_sbm output

Below, some explanation will be given on how to prepare a basic wflow\_sbm
model. Example data for other model configurations is provided in the section with [sample
data](@ref sample_data).

## wflow\_sbm

Wflow\_sbm represents hydrological models derived from the CQflow model (Köhler et al., 2006)
that have the [SBM](@ref vert_sbm) vertical concept in common, but can have different
lateral concepts that control how water is routed for example over the land or river domain.
The soil part of SBM is largely based on the Topog\_SBM model but has had considerable
changes over time. Topog\_SBM is specifically designed to simulate fast runoff processes in
small catchments while the wflow\_sbm model can be applied more widely. The main differences are
for the vertical concept SBM of wflow\_sbm:

- The unsaturated zone can be split-up in different layers
- The addition of evapotranspiration losses
- The addition of a capillary rise
- The addition of water demand and allocation

The water demand and allocation computations are supported by the wflow\_sbm model
configurations:

- [SBM + Kinematic wave](@ref config_sbm)
- [SBM + Groundwater flow](@ref config_sbm_gwf)
- [SBM + Local inertial river](@ref config_sbm_gwf_lie_river)
- [SBM + Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D)](@ref config_sbm_gwf_lie_river_land)

The vertical SBM concept is explained in more detail in the following section [SBM vertical
concept](@ref vert_sbm).

Topog\_SBM uses an element network based on contour lines and trajectories for water
routing. Wflow\_sbm models differ in how the lateral components river, land, and subsurface
are solved. Below the different wflow\_sbm model configurations are described.

### SBM + Kinematic wave
For the lateral components of this wflow\_sbm model water is routed over a D8 network, and
the kinematic wave approach is used for river, overland and lateral subsurface flow. This is
described in more detail in the section [Kinematic wave](@ref kin_wave).

An overview of the different processes and fluxes in the wflow_sbm model with the kinematic
wave approach for river, overland and lateral subsurface flow:

![Conceptual overview of the wflow_sbm model](../images/wflow_sbm_soil.png)

Below the mapping for this wflow\_sbm model (type `sbm`) to the vertical SBM concept
(instance of `struct SBM`) and the different lateral concepts is presented. For an
explanation about the type parameters between curly braces after the `struct` name see the
section on the model parameters.

```julia
vertical => struct SBM{T,N,M}
lateral.subsurface => struct LateralSSF{T}
lateral.land => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river.lake => struct NaturalLake{T} # optional
lateral.river.reservoir => struct SimpleReservoir{T} # optional
```

### SBM + Groundwater flow
For river and overland flow the kinematic wave approach over a D8 network is used for this
wflow\_sbm model. For the subsurface domain, an unconfined aquifer with groundwater flow in
four directions (adjacent cells) is used. This is described in more detail in the section
[Groundwater flow](@ref lateral_gwf).

```toml
[model]
type = "sbm_gwf"

[input.lateral.subsurface]
ksathorfrac = "KsatHorFrac"
conductivity = "conductivity"
specific_yield = "specific_yield"
exfiltration_conductance = "exfilt_cond"
infiltration_conductance = "infilt_cond"
river_bottom = "river_bottom"
conductivity_profile = "exponential"
gwf_f.value = 3.0
```
Below the mapping for this wflow\_sbm model (type `sbm_gwf`) to the vertical SBM concept
(instance of `struct SBM`) and the different lateral concepts. For an explanation about the
type parameters between curly braces after the `struct` name see the section on model parameters.

```julia
vertical => struct SBM{T,N,M}
lateral.subsurface.flow => struct GroundwaterFlow{A, B}
lateral.subsurface.recharge => struct Recharge{T} <: AquiferBoundaryCondition
lateral.subsurface.river => struct River{T} <: AquiferBoundaryCondition
lateral.subsurface.drain => struct Drainage{T} <: AquiferBoundaryCondition # optional
lateral.land => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river.lake => struct NaturalLake{T} # optional
lateral.river.reservoir => struct SimpleReservoir{T} # optional
```

### SBM + Local inertial river
By default the model types `sbm` and `sbm_gwf` use the kinematic wave approach for river
flow. There is also the option to use the local inertial model for river flow with an
optional 1D floodplain schematization (routing is done separately for the river channel and
floodplain), by providing the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
river_routing = "local-inertial"    # optional, default is "kinematic-wave"
floodplain_1d = true                # optional, default is false
```

Only the mapping for the river component changes, as shown below. For an explanation about
the type parameters between curly braces after the `struct` name see the section on the model
parameters.

```julia
lateral.river => struct ShallowWaterRiver{T,R,L}
```

### SBM + Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D)
By default the model types `sbm` and `sbm_gwf` use the kinematic wave approach for river and
overland flow. There is also the option to use the local inertial model for 1D river and 2D
overland flow, by providing the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
river_routing = "local-inertial"
land_routing = "local-inertial"
```
The mapping for the river and land component changes, as shown below. For an explanation
about the type parameters between curly braces after the `struct` name see the section on
the model parameters.

```julia
lateral.river => struct ShallowWaterRiver{T,R,L}
lateral.land => struct ShallowWaterLand{T}
```

The local inertial approach is described in more detail in the section [Local inertial
model](@ref local_inertial).

## wflow\_sediment
The processes and fate of many particles and pollutants impacting water quality at the
catchment level are intricately linked to the processes governing sediment dynamics. Both
nutrients such as phosphorus, carbon or other pollutants such as metals are influenced by
sediment properties in processes such as mobilization, flocculation or deposition. To better
assert and model water quality in inland systems, a better comprehension and modelling of
sediment sources and fate in the river is needed at a spatial and time scale relevant to
such issues.

The wflow\_sediment model was developed to answer such issues. It is a distributed
physics-based model, based on the distributed hydrologic wflow\_sbm model. It is able to
simulate both land and in-stream processes, and relies on available global datasets,
parameter estimation and small calibration effort.

In order to model the exports of terrestrial sediment to the coast through the Land Ocean
Aquatic Continuum or LOAC (inland waters network such as streams, lakes...), two different
modelling parts were considered. The first part, called the inland sediment model, is the
modelling and estimation of soil loss and sediment yield to the river system by land
erosion, separated into vertical [Soil Erosion](@ref) processes and lateral [Sediment Flux
in overland flow](@ref). The second part, called the [River Sediment Model](@ref) is the
transport and processes of the sediment in the river system. The two parts together
constitute the wflow\_sediment model.

Overview of the concepts of the wflow\_sediment model:
![wflow_sediment](../images/wflow_sediment.png)

### Configuration

As sediment generation and transport processes are linked to the hydrology and water flows,
the inputs to the wflow\_sediment model come directly from a hydrological model. The
required dynamic inputs to run wflow\_sediment are:

-  Precipitation (can also come from the hydrological forcing data),
-  Land runoff (overland flow) from the kinematic wave,
-  River runoff from the kinematic wave,
-  Land water level in the kinematic wave,
-  River water level in the kinematic wave,
-  Rainfall interception by the vegetation.

These inputs can be obtained from wflow\_sbm or from other sources.

Model outputs can be saved for both the inland and the instream part of the model. Some
examples are listed below.

```toml
[output.vertical]
# Soil splash erosion [ton]
sedspl = "sedspl"
# Soil erosion by overland flow [ton]
sedov = "sedov"
# Total soil loss [ton]
soilloss = "soilloss"
# Total transport capacity of overland flow [ton]
TCsed = "TCsed"
# Transport capacity per particle class (clay) [ton]
TCclay = "TCclay"

[output.lateral.land]
# Total (or per particle class) sediment flux in overland flow [ton]
olsed = "olsed"
olclay = "olclay"
# Total (or per particle class) sediment yield to the river [ton]
inlandsed = "inlandsed"
inlandclay = "inlandclay"

[output.lateral.river]
# Total sediment concentration in the river (suspended + bed load) [kg/m3]
Sedconc = "Sedconc"
# Suspended load [kg/m3]
SSconc = "SSconc"
# Bed load [kg/m3]
Bedconc = "Bedconc"
```
