title: About
---

As opposed to the user guide, which describes the steps needed to build and apply a model in
the software, this section explains the different model concepts that are available within
the wflow modelling framework. Descriptions are given regarding the model concepts with
references to scientific papers that explain the concepts in more detail. The model
parameters which influence the processes are also shown, using inline code blocks. An
overview of all model parameters, states and output variables is also provided for easy
reference, including their standard names, descriptions, units and default values for input
parameters.
