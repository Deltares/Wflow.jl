title: Run wflow as a ZMQ Server
---

It is possible to run wflow as a ZMQ Server, for example for the coupling to the
[OpenDA](https://openda.org/) software for data-assimilation. The code for the wflow ZMQ Server
is not part of the Wflow.jl package, and is located
[here](https://github.com/Deltares/Wflow.jl/tree/master/server).
