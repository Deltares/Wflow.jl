title: Simulation settings
---

All model configuration and settings are passed through the .toml file, which contains all
relevant settings, information about the model configuration, simulation period, input files,
and parameters. The settings are provided in a TOML file. The settings file is structured in
several sections, which are explained below. The file paths provided in this file are relative
to the location of the TOML file, or to `dir_input` and `dir_output` if they are specified.

## General time info
Time information is optional. When omitted, wflow will perform computations for each timestamp
in the forcing netCDF file, except for the first forcing timestamp, which is considered equal
to the initial conditions of the wflow model (state time). If you wish to calculate a subset of
this time range, or a different timestep, you can specify a `starttime`, `endtime` and
`timestepsecs`. The `starttime` is defined as the model state time. In the TOML file settings
below, the `starttime` is 2000-01-01T00:00:00 (state time) and the first update (and output) of
the wflow model is at 2000-01-02T00:00:00. The `time_units` optional information is used by the
`writer` of the model, for model output in netCDF format. The `calendar` option allows you to
calculate in one of the different [CF conventions
calendars](http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#calendar) provided by
the [CFTime.jl package](https://juliageo.org/CFTime.jl/latest/), such as `"360_day"`. This is
useful if you want to calculate climate scenarios which are sometimes provided in these
alternative calendars.

```toml
calendar = "standard"                           # optional, this is the default value
starttime = 2000-01-01T00:00:00                 # optional, default from forcing netCDF
endtime = 2000-02-01T00:00:00                   # optional, default from forcing netCDF
time_units = "days since 1900-01-01 00:00:00"   # optional, this is the default value
timestepsecs = 86400                            # optional, default from forcing netCDF
dir_input = "data/input"                        # optional, default is the path of the TOML
dir_output = "data/output"                      # optional, default is the path of the TOML
```

## Logging
Wflow prints logging messages at various levels such as debug, info, and error. These messages
are sent to both the terminal and a log file. Note that logging to a file is only part of the
`Wflow.run(tomlpath::AbstractString)` method. If you want to debug an issue, it can be helpful
to set `loglevel = "debug"` in the TOML. To avoid flooding the screen, debug messages are only
sent to the log file. The following settings will affect the logging:

```toml
silent = false          # optional, default is "false"
loglevel = "debug"      # optional, default is "info"
path_log = "log.txt"    # optional, default is "log.txt"
fews_run = false        # optional, default value is false
```

`silent` avoids logging to the terminal, and only writes to the log file. `loglevel` controls
which levels are filtered out; for instance, the default setting `"info"` does not print any
debug-level messages. Note that for finer control, you can also pass an integer log level. For
details, see Julia's
[Logging](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Logging/#Log-event-structure) documentation.
`path_log` sets the desired output path for the log file. For information on `fews_run`, see
[Run from Delft-FEWS](./fews.qmd).

## Model section
Model-specific settings can be included in the model section of the TOML file.

```toml
[model]
type = "sbm"                        # one of ("sbm" or "sbm_gwf)
masswasting = false                 # include lateral snow transport in the model, default is false
snow = false                        # include snow modelling, default is false
reinit = true                       # cold (reinit = true) or warm state (reinit = false), default is true
reservoirs = false                  # include reservoir modelling, default is false
kin_wave_iteration = false          # enable kinematic wave iterations in the model, default is false
thicknesslayers = [100, 300, 800]   # specific SBM setting: for each soil layer, a thickness [mm] is specified
min_streamorder_river = 5           # minimum stream order to delineate subbasins for river domain, default is 6 (for multi-threading computing purposes)
min_streamorder_land = 4            # minimum stream order to delineate subbasins for land domain, default is 5 (for multi-threading computing purposes)
```

## State options
The `state` section in the TOML file provides information about the location of input and
output states of the model. This section is mostly relevant if the model needs to start with a
"warm" state (i.e. based on the results of a previous simulation). The example below shows how
to save the output states of the current simulation, so it can be used to initialize another
model in the future. Details on the settings required to start a model with a warm state can be
found in the [additional model options](./warm_states.qmd). If it is not required to store the
outstates of the current simulation, the entire `state` section can be removed.

```toml
[state]
path_input = "instates-moselle.nc"
path_output = "outstates-moselle.nc"

[state.vertical]
satwaterdepth = "satwaterdepth"
snow = "snow"
tsoil = "tsoil"
ustorelayerdepth = "ustorelayerdepth"
snowwater = "snowwater"
canopystorage = "canopystorage"

[state.lateral.river]
q = "q_river"
h = "h_river"
h_av = "h_av_river"

[state.lateral.river.reservoir]
volume = "volume_reservoir"

[state.lateral.subsurface]
ssf = "ssf"

[state.lateral.land]
q = "q_land"
h = "h_land"
h_av = "h_av_land"
```

## Input section
The `input` section of the TOML file contains information about the input forcing and model
parameters files (in netCDF format). Forcing is applied to the vertical component of the model,
and needs to be mapped to the external netCDF variable name. `forcing` lists the internal model
forcing parameters, and these are mapped to the external netCDF variables listed under the
section `[input.vertical]`. It is possible to provide cyclic parameters to the model (minimum
time step of 1 day). In the example below, the internal `vertical.leaf_area_index` model
parameter is mapped to the external netCDF variable "LAI" variable. Cyclic time inputs of
parameters can be different (e.g., daily or monthly). The `time` dimension name of these cylic
input parameters in the model parameter netCDF file should start with "time". If a model
parameter is not mapped, a default value will be used, if available.

```toml
[input]
# use "forcing-year-*.nc" if forcing files are split in time
path_forcing = "forcing-moselle.nc"    # Location of the forcing data
path_static = "staticmaps-moselle.nc"  # Location of the static data

# these are not directly part of the model
gauges = "wflow_gauges"
ldd = "wflow_ldd"
river_location = "wflow_river"
subcatchment = "wflow_subcatch"

# specify the internal IDs of the parameters which vary over time
# the external name mapping needs to be below together with the other mappings
forcing = [
"vertical.precipitation",
"vertical.temperature",
"vertical.potential_evaporation",
]

cyclic = ["vertical.leaf_area_index"]

[input.vertical]    # Map internal model variable/parameter names to variable names in the netCDF files
altitude = "wflow_dem"
c = "c"
cf_soil = "cf_soil"
cfmax = "Cfmax"
e_r = "EoverR"
infiltcappath = "InfiltCapPath"
infiltcapsoil = "InfiltCapSoil"
kext = "Kext"
"kv_0" = "KsatVer"
leaf_area_index = "LAI"             # Cyclic variable
m = "M"
maxleakage = "MaxLeakage"
pathfrac = "PathFrac"
potential_evaporation = "PET"       # Forcing variable
precipitation = "P"                 # Forcing variable
rootdistpar = "rootdistpar"
rootingdepth = "RootingDepth"
soilminthickness = "SoilMinThickness"
soilthickness = "SoilThickness"
specific_leaf = "Sl"
storage_wood = "Swood"
temperature = "TEMP"                # Forcing variable
tt = "TT"
tti = "TTI"
ttm = "TTM"
w_soil = "wflow_soil"
water_holding_capacity = "WHC"
waterfrac = "WaterFrac"
"theta_r" = "thetaR"
"theta_s" = "thetaS"

[input.lateral.river]
length = "wflow_riverlength"
n = "N_River"
slope = "RiverSlope"
width = "wflow_riverwidth"

[input.lateral.subsurface]
ksathorfrac = "KsatHorFrac"

[input.lateral.land]
n = "N"
slope = "Slope"
```

## Output netCDF section

### Grid data
This optional section of the TOML file specifies the output netCDF file for writing gridded
model output. It includes a mapping between internal model parameter components and external
netCDF variables.

To limit the size of the resulting netCDF file, file compression can be enabled. Compression
increases computational time but can significantly reduce the size of the netCDF file. Set
the `compressionlevel` variable to a value between `0` and `9`. A setting of `0` means no
compression, while values between 1 and 9 indicate increasing levels of compression (1:
least compression, minimal run-time impact, 9: highest compression, maximum run-time
impact). If file size is a concern, we recommend using a value of `1`, as higher compression
levels generally have a limited effect on file size.

```toml
[output]
path = "output_moselle.nc"         # Location of the output file
compressionlevel = 1               # Compression level (default 0)

[output.vertical]   # Mapping of names between internal model components and external netCDF variables
satwaterdepth = "satwaterdepth"
snow = "snow"
tsoil = "tsoil"
ustorelayerdepth = "ustorelayerdepth"
snowwater = "snowwater"
canopystorage = "canopystorage"

[output.lateral.river]
q = "q_river"
h = "h_river"

[output.lateral.river.reservoir]
volume = "volume_reservoir"

[output.lateral.subsurface]
ssf = "ssf"

[output.lateral.land]
q = "q_land"
h = "h_land"
```

### Scalar data
In addition to gridded data, scalar data can also be written to a netCDF file. Below is an
example that shows how to write scalar data to the file "output\_scalar\_moselle.nc". For each
netCDF variable, a `name` (external variable name) and a `parameter` (internal model parameter)
are required. A `reducer` can be specified to apply to the model output. See more details in
the [Output CSV section](#output-csv-section) section. If a `map` is provided to extract data
for specific locations (e.g. `gauges`) or areas (e.g. `subcatchment`), the netCDF location
names are extracted from these maps. For a specific location (grid cell) a `location` is
required. For layered model parameters and variables that have an extra `layer` dimension and
are part of the vertical `sbm` concept, an internal layer index can be specified (an example is
provided below). Similarly, for model parameters and variables that have an extra dimension
`classes` and are part of the vertical `FLEXTopo` concept, the class name can be specified. If
multiple layers or classes are desired, this can be specified in separate `[[netcdf.variable]]`
entries. Note that the additional dimension should be specified when wflow is integrated with
Delft-FEWS, for netCDF scalar data an extra dimension is not allowed by the
`importNetcdfActivity` of the Delft-FEWS General Adapter. In the section [Output CSV
section](#output-csv-section), similar functionality is available for CSV. For integration with
Delft-FEWS, it is recommended to write scalar data to netCDF format, as the General Adapter of
Delft-FEWS can directly ingest data from netCDF files. For more information, see [Run from
Delft-FEWS](./fews.qmd).

```toml
[netcdf]
path = "output_scalar_moselle.nc"  # Location of the results

[[netcdf.variable]] # Extract the values of lateral.river.q using the gauges map, and assign it with the name 'Q' as a variable in the netCDF file
name = "Q"
map = "gauges"
parameter = "lateral.river.q"

[[netcdf.variable]] # Using coordinates to extract temperature
coordinate.x = 6.255
coordinate.y = 50.012
name = "vwc_layer2_bycoord"
location = "vwc_bycoord"
parameter = "vertical.vwc"
layer = 2

[[netcdf.variable]] # Using indices to extract temperature
location = "temp_byindex"
name = "temp_index"
index.x = 100
index.y = 264
parameter = "vertical.temperature"
```

## Output CSV section
Model output can also be written to a CSV file. Below is an example that writes model output to
the file "output_moselle.csv". For each CSV column, a `header` and `parameter` (internal model
parameter) are required. A `reducer` can be specified to apply to the model output, with the
following available reducers:

+ maximum
+ minimum
+ mean
+ median
+ sum
+ first
+ last
+ only

with `only` as the default. To extract data for a specific location (grid cell), the `index` of
the vector, the coordinates `coordinate.x` and `coordinate.y`, or the x and y indices of the 2D
array (`index.x` and `index.y`) can be provided. Additionally, a `map` can be provided to
extract data for certain locations (e.g. `gauges`) or areas (e.g. `subcatchment`). In this
case, a single entry can lead to multiple columns in the CSV file, which will be of the form
`header_id`, e.g. `Q_20`, for a gauge with integer ID 20. For layered model parameters and
variables that have an extra dimension `layer` and are part of the vertical `sbm` concept an
internal layer index (see also example below) should be specified. For model parameters and
variables that have an extra dimension `classes` and are part of the vertical `FLEXTopo`
concept, it is possible to specify the class name. If multiple layers or classes are desired,
this can be specified in separate `[[csv.column]]` entries.

The double brackets in `[[csv.column]]` follow TOML syntax, indicating that it is part of a
list. You can specify as many entries as you want.

```toml
[csv]
path = "output_moselle.csv"

[[csv.column]]
header = "Q"
parameter = "lateral.river.q"
reducer = "maximum"

[[csv.column]]
header = "volume"
index = 1
parameter = "lateral.river.reservoir.volume"

[[csv.column]]
coordinate.x = 6.255
coordinate.y = 50.012
header = "temp_bycoord"
parameter = "vertical.temperature"

[[csv.column]]
coordinate.x = 6.255
coordinate.y = 50.012
header = "vwc_layer2_bycoord"
parameter = "vertical.vwc"
layer = 2

[[csv.column]]
header = "temp_byindex"
index.x = 100
index.y = 264
parameter = "vertical.temperature"

[[csv.column]]
header = "Q"
map = "gauges"
parameter = "lateral.river.q"

[[csv.column]]
header = "recharge"
map = "subcatchment"
parameter = "vertical.recharge"
reducer = "mean"
```

## Modify parameters
It is possible to modify model parameters and forcing through the TOML file. Two options to
modify input parameters are available:

- Set an input parameter (static) to a uniform value.
- Modify an input parameter (cyclic and static) or forcing variable using a `scale` factor
  and `offset`.

For example, to set the input parameter `cfmax` to an uniform value of 2.5:

```toml
[input.vertical]
water_holding_capacity = "WHC"
waterfrac = "WaterFrac"
cfmax.value = 2.5
```

For input parameters with an extra dimension (e.g. `layer` or `classes`), one uniform value can
be provided or a list of values that matches the length of the additional dimension. For
example, a list of values can be provided for input parameter `c` as follows:

```toml
[input.vertical]
water_holding_capacity = "WHC"
waterfrac = "WaterFrac"
c.value = [10.5, 11.25, 9.5, 7.0]
```

To change the forcing variable `precipitation` with a `scale` factor of 1.5 and an `offset` of
0.5:

```toml
[input.vertical.precipitation]
netcdf.variable.name = "P"
scale = 1.5
offset = 0.5
```

For input parameters with an extra dimension, it is also possible to modify multiple indices
simultaneously with different `scale` and `offset` values. In the example below, the external
netCDF variable `c` is modified at `layer` index 1 and 2, with a `scale` factor of 2.0 and 1.5
respectively, and an `offset` of 0.0 for both indices:

```toml
[input.vertical.c]
netcdf.variable.name = "c"
scale = [2.0, 1.5]
offset = [0.0, 0.0]
layer = [1, 2]
```

## Fixed forcing values
It is possible to set fixed values for forcing parameters through the TOML file. For example,
to set `temperature` to a fixed value of 10 ``\degree``C, the complete `forcing` list is
required:

```toml
forcing = [
  "vertical.precipitation",
  "vertical.temperature",
  "vertical.potential_evaporation",
]

[input.vertical.temperature]
value = 10
```

Note that the mapping to the external netCDF variable listed under the `[input.vertical]`
section needs to be removed or commented out:

```toml
[input.vertical]
potential_evaporation = "PET" # forcing
# temperature = "TEMP" # forcing
precipitation = "P" # forcing
```
