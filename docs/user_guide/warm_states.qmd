title: Starting with "warm" states
---

The `state` section in the TOML file provides information on the input file if the model is
initialized with a warm state (`path_input`) and to what file the states are written at the
end of the model run (`path_output`). Please note that the model setting `cold_start__flag`
needs to be set to `false` in order to initialize the model with states from the file
located at `path_input`. A mapping between external netCDF variable state names and model
state variable standard names is required below the `[state.variables]` section. The model
state variable standard names are listed on the left side, and the external netCDF variable
state names are listed on the right side. Note that `path_input` is only required when
`cold_start__flag` is set to false. `path_output` is optional, an output state file is only
written when it is defined. If neither is set, the entire `state` section can be left out.

```toml

cold_start__flag = false # cold (cold_start__flag = true) or warm state (cold_start__flag = false), default is true

[state]
path_input = "data/instates-moselle.nc"     # Location of the file with the input states
path_output = "data/outstates-moselle.nc"   # Output location of the states after the model run
