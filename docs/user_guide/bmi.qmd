title: Basic Model Interface (BMI)
---

## Introduction
The [Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page)
(CSMDS) has developed the Basic Model Interface (BMI). BMI consists of a set of standard
control and query functions that can be added by a developer to the model code and makes a
model both easier to learn and easier to couple with other software elements.

For more information see also: <http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI_Description>

CSDMS provides specifications for the languages C, C++, Fortran and Python. Wflow, written in
the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/), makes use of the following [Julia
specification](https://github.com/Deltares/BasicModelInterface.jl), based on BMI 2.0 version.

For the BMI implementation of wflow all grids are defined as [unstructured
grids](https://bmi-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_grids.html#unstructured-grids),
including the special cases `scalar` and `points`. While the input (forcing and model
parameters) is structured (uniform rectilinear), internally wflow works with one dimensional
arrays based on the active grid cells of the 2D model domain.

## Configuration
The variables that wflow can exchange through BMI are model state and output variables. The
standard names of these variables based on [CSDMS Standard
Names](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Standard_Names) should be listed below the
`API` section in the `variables` list of the TOML configuration file. Below an example of
this `API` section, that lists the variables that wflow can exchange through BMI:

```toml
[API]
variables = [
   "river_water__volume_flow_rate",
   "soil_water_unsaturated_zone__depth",
   "soil_water__transpiration_volume_flux",
   "soil_layer_1_water_unsaturated_zone__depth",
   "soil_layer_2_water_unsaturated_zone__depth",
   "soil_layer_3_water_unsaturated_zone__depth",
   "soil_layer_4_water_unsaturated_zone__depth",
]
```

Variables with a third dimension, for example `layer` as part of the `SBM` `soil` model, are
exposed as two-dimensional grids through the wflow BMI implementation. For these variables
the index of this third dimension is required, by adding `k` to the `layer` part of the
variable standard name (`k` refers to the index of the third dimension): `layer_k`. For
example, the variable `soil_layer_1_water_unsaturated_zone__depth` refers to the amount of water
in the unsaturated store of the first soil layer of the `SBM` `soil` model.

The model state and output variable standard names are provided in the "Model parameters and
variables" section of the [Model documentation](../model_docs/parameters_intro.qmd).
