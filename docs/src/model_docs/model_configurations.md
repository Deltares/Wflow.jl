# Model configurations

## wflow\_sbm

Wflow\_sbm represents hydrological models derived from the CQflow model (KÃ¶hler et al., 2006) 
that have the [SBM](@ref vert_sbm) vertical concept in common, but can have different
lateral concepts that control how water is routed for example over the land or river domain.
The soil part of SBM is largely based on the Topog\_SBM model but has had considerable
changes over time. Topog\_SBM is specifically designed to simulate fast runoff processes in
small catchments while wflow\_sbm model can be applied more widely. The main differences are
for the vertical concept SBM of wflow\_sbm:

- The unsaturated zone can be split-up in different layers
- The addition of evapotranspiration losses
- The addition of a capillary rise

The vertical SBM concept is explained in more detail in the following section [SBM vertical
concept](@ref vert_sbm).

Topog\_SBM uses an element network based on contour lines and trajectories for water
routing. Wflow\_sbm models differ in how the lateral components river, land, and subsurface  
are solved. Below the different wflow\_sbm model configurations are described.

### SBM + Kinematic wave
For the lateral components of this wflow\_sbm model water is routed over a D8 network, and
the kinematic wave approach is used for river, overland and lateral subsurface flow. This is
described in more detail in the section [Kinematic wave](@ref kin_wave).

An overview of the different processes and fluxes in the wflow_sbm model with the kinematic
wave approach for river, overland and lateral subsurface flow:

Below the mapping for this wflow\_sbm model (type `sbm`) to the vertical SBM concept
(instance of `struct SBM`) and the different lateral concepts is presented. For an
explanation about the type parameters between curly braces after the `struct` name see the
section on the model parameters.

```julia
vertical => struct SBM{T,N,M}
lateral.subsurface => struct LateralSSF{T}
lateral.land => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river.lake => struct NaturalLake{T} # optional
lateral.river.reservoir => struct SimpleReservoir{T} # optional
```

### SBM + Local inertial river
By default the model type `sbm` uses the kinematic wave approach for river flow. There is
also the option to use the local inertial model for river flow, by providing the following
in the TOML file:  

```toml
[model]
river_routing = "local-inertial"
```

Only the mapping for the river component changes, as shown below. For an explanation about
the type parameters between curly braces after the `struct` name see the section on the model 
parameters.

```julia
lateral.river => struct ShallowWaterRiver{T,R,L}
```

### SBM + Local inertial river (1D) and land (2D)
By default the model type `sbm` uses the kinematic wave approach for river and overland
flow. There is also the option to use the local inertial model for 1D river and 2D overland
flow, by providing the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
river_routing = "local-inertial"
land_routing = "local-inertial"
```
The mapping for the river and land component changes, as shown below. For an explanation
about the type parameters between curly braces after the `struct` name see the section on 
the model parameters. 

```julia
lateral.river => struct ShallowWaterRiver{T,R,L}
lateral.land => struct ShallowWaterLand{T}
```

The local inertial approach is described in more detail in the section [Local inertial
model](@ref local_inertial).

### SBM + Groundwater flow
For river and overland flow the kinematic wave approach over a D8 network is used for this
wflow\_sbm model. For the subsurface domain, an unconfined aquifer with groundwater flow in
four directions (adjacent cells) is used. This is described in more detail in the section
[Groundwater flow](@ref lateral_gwf).

Below the mapping for this wflow\_sbm model (type `sbm_gwf`) to the vertical SBM concept
(instance of `struct SBM`) and the different lateral concepts. For an explanation about the
type parameters between curly braces after the `struct` name see the section on model parameters.

```julia
vertical => struct SBM{T,N,M}
lateral.subsurface.flow => struct GroundwaterFlow{A, B}
lateral.subsurface.recharge => struct Recharge{T} <: AquiferBoundaryCondition
lateral.subsurface.river => struct River{T} <: AquiferBoundaryCondition
lateral.subsurface.drain => struct Drainage{T} <: AquiferBoundaryCondition # optional
lateral.land => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river.lake => struct NaturalLake{T} # optional
lateral.river.reservoir => struct SimpleReservoir{T} # optional
```

## [wflow\_hbv](@id config_hbv)
The Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model was introduced back in 1972 by the
Swedisch Meteological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI).  The HBV model is mainly used for
runoff simulation and hydrological forecasting. The model is particularly useful for
catchments where snow fall and snow melt are dominant factors, but application of the model
is by no means restricted to these type of catchments.

The model is based on the HBV-96 model. However, the hydrological routing represent in HBV
by a triangular function controlled by the MAXBAS parameter has been removed. Instead, the
kinematic wave function is used to route the water downstream. All runoff that is generated
in a cell in one of the HBV reservoirs is added to the kinematic wave reservoir at the end
of a timestep. There is no connection between the different HBV cells within the model.

A catchment is divided into a number of grid cells. For each of the cells individually,
daily runoff is computed through application of the HBV-96 of the HBV model. The use of the
grid cells offers the possibility to turn the HBV modelling concept, which is originally
lumped, into a distributed model.

![wflow_hbv model](../images/hbv96.png)

The figure above shows a schematic view of hydrological response simulation with the
HBV-modelling concept. The land-phase of the hydrological cycle is represented by three
different components: a snow routine, a soil routine and a runoff response routine. Each
component is discussed in more detail below.

The vertical HBV concept is described in section [HBV vertical concept](@ref vert_hbv). The
routing for river and overland flow is described in the section [Kinematic wave](@ref
kin_wave).

Below the mapping for wflow\_hbv (type `hbv`) to the vertical HBV concept (instance of
`struct HBV`) and the different lateral concepts. For an explanation about the type
parameters between curly braces after the `struct` name see the section on model parameters.

```julia
vertical => struct HBV{T}
lateral.subsurface => struct LateralSSF{T}
lateral.land => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river => struct SurfaceFlow{T,R,L}
lateral.river.lake => struct NaturalLake{T} # optional
lateral.river.reservoir => struct SimpleReservoir{T} # optional
```

## [wflow\_flextopo](@id config_flextopo)
The FLEXTopo model is a process-based model, which consists of different parallel classes
connected through their groundwater storage. These classes are usually delineated from
topographical data to represent the variability in hydrological processes across
user-defined Hydrological Response Units (HRU). The main assumption underlying the concept,
which was first introduced by Savenije (2010), is that different parts of the landscape
fulfill different tasks in runoff generation and, hence, can be represented by different
model structures. The strength of the concept is that the definition of classes and
associated model structures is modular and flexible and not fixed to a predefined model
structure. The flexible approach allows to develop process-based models for different
topographic, climatic, geologic and land use conditions, making use of the available data
and expert knowledge.

The kinematic wave function is used to route the water downstream. In a similar way as for
HBV, all runoff that is generated in a cell in one of the FLEXTopo storages is added to the
kinematic wave reservoir at the end of a timestep. There is no connection between the
different vertical FLEXTopo cells within the model. The FLEXTopo model is implemented in a
fully distributed way in the Wflow Julia framework.

In wflow\_flextopo, the user is free to determine the number of classes and which model
components to include or exclude for each class, this is done in the TOML file. Currently,
for each storage, it is possible to bypass the storage and pass on the fluxes to the next
model component. Interested users can contribute to the code by adding other
conceptualizations for each storage components.

```julia
[model]
type = "flextopo"
classes = ["h", "p", "w"]     #user can set the number and name of each class.

# for each component which is class specific, the user can select which conceptualization
# to apply for each class as defined above in classes = ["h", "p", "w"]
select_snow = ["common_snow_hbv"]
# available options are ["common_snow_hbv", "common_snow_no_storage"]
select_interception = ["interception_overflow", "interception_overflow", "interception_overflow"]
# available options are ["interception_overflow", "interception_no_storage"]
select_hortonponding = ["hortonponding_no_storage", "hortonponding_no_storage", "hortonponding_no_storage"]
# available options are ["hortonponding", "hortonponding_no_storage"]
select_hortonrunoff = ["hortonrunoff_no_storage", "hortonrunoff_no_storage", "hortonrunoff_no_storage"]
# available options are ["hortonrunoff", "hortonrunoff_no_storage"]
select_rootzone = ["rootzone_storage", "rootzone_storage", "rootzone_storage"]
# available options are ["rootzone_storage", "rootzone_no_storage"]
select_fast = ["fast_storage", "fast_storage", "fast_storage"]
# available options are ["fast_storage", "fast_no_storage"]
select_slow = ["common_slow_storage"]
# available options are ["common_slow_storage", "slow_no_storage"]
```

A schematic representation of the most complete model structure including all storage
components, as currently implemented in the code, is shown in the Figure below. When setting
up the model with multiple classes, model structures can be adapted by bypassing storages or
turning parameter values on or off (e.g.: percolation or capillary rise, non-linear versus
linear outflow of the fast runoff etc.), an example of a three class model is shown in
[FLEXTopo vertical concept](@ref vert_flextopo).

![flextopo_julia_1class.png](../images/flextopo_julia_1class.png)
*Schematic representation of the FLEXTopo model for a single class model including all
storages and fluxes. Main parameters are denoted in red.*

In the staticmaps, the user needs to provide maps of the fraction of each class within each
cell, as shown below with `hrufrac`. For each model parameter which is class specific, an
extra dimension `classes` is required in the staticmaps netcdf. For an example model, see
[FLEXTopo example model](@ref wflow_flextopo_data).

```julia
[input.vertical]
hrufrac = "hrufrac_lu"
```

Parameter multiplication of model parameters which are defined for several classes is
possible through the TOML file:

```julia
[input.vertical.kf]
netcdf.variable.name = "kf"
scale = [1.0, 3.0, 4.0]
offset = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
class = ["h", "p", "w"]
```

## wflow\_sediment
The processes and fate of many particles and pollutants impacting water quality at the
catchment level are intricately linked to the processes governing sediment dynamics. Both
nutrients such as phosphorus, carbon or other pollutants such as metals are influenced by
sediment properties in processes such as mobilization, flocculation or deposition. To better
assert and model water quality in inland systems, a better comprehension and modelling of
sediment sources and fate in the river is needed at a spatial and time scale relevant to
such issues. 

The wflow\_sediment model was developed to answer such issues. It is a distributed
physics-based model, based on the distributed hydrologic wflow\_sbm model. It is able to
simulate both land and in-stream processes, and relies on available global datasets,
parameter estimation and small calibration effort.

In order to model the exports of terrestrial sediment to the coast through the Land Ocean
Aquatic Continuum or LOAC (inland waters network such as streams, lakes...), two different
modelling parts were considered. The first part, called the inland sediment model, is the
modelling and estimation of soil loss and sediment yield to the river system by land
erosion, separated into vertical [Soil Erosion](@ref) processes and lateral [Sediment Flux
in overland flow](@ref). The second part, called the [River Sediment Model](@ref) is the
transport and processes of the sediment in the river system. The two parts together
constitute the wflow\_sediment model.

Overview of the concepts of the wflow\_sediment model:
![wflow_sediment](../images/wflow_sediment.png)

### Configuration

As sediment generation and transport processes are linked to the hydrology and water flows,
the inputs to the wflow\_sediment model come directly from a hydrological model. The
required dynamic inputs to run wflow\_sediment are:

-  Precipitation (can also come from the hydrological forcing data),
-  Land runoff (overland flow) from the kinematic wave,
-  River runoff from the kinematic wave,
-  Land water level in the kinematic wave,
-  River water level in the kinematic wave,
-  Rainfall interception by the vegetation.

These inputs can be obtained from other wflow models such as wflow\_sbm, wflow\_hbv or from
other sources.

Model outputs can be saved for both the inland and the instream part of the model. Some
examples are listed below.

```toml
[output.vertical]
# Soil splash erosion [ton]
sedspl = "sedspl"
# Soil erosion by overland flow [ton]
sedov = "sedov"
# Total soil loss [ton]
soilloss = "soilloss"
# Total transport capacity of overland flow [ton]
TCsed = "TCsed"
# Transport capacity per particle class (clay) [ton]
TCclay = "TCclay"

[output.lateral.land]
# Total (or per particle class) sediment flux in overland flow [ton]
olsed = "olsed"
olclay = "olclay"
# Total (or per particle class) sediment yield to the river [ton]
inlandsed = "inlandsed"
inlandclay = "inlandclay"

[output.lateral.river]
# Total sediment concentration in the river (suspended + bed load) [kg/m3]
Sedconc = "Sedconc"
# Suspended load [kg/m3]
SSconc = "SSconc"
# Bed load [kg/m3]
Bedconc = "Bedconc"
```
