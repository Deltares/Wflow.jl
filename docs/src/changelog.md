## Unreleased


## v0.2.0 - 2021-03-26

### Changed
- Removed dependency of the `f` model parameter of wflow\_sbm on the parameters
  ``\theta_{s}``, ``\theta_{r}`` and ``M``. This approach is used in Topog\_SBM, but not
  applicable for wflow\_sbm. The `f` parameter needs to be provided as part of the NetCDF
  model parameter file.
- Grid properties as cell length and elevation now stored as part of the
  `model.land.network` component and not as part of the vertical model components, as it is
  not used by these components. `altitude` (elevation) should now be provided as part of the
  `[input]` section of the TOML configuration file, and not as part of the
  `[input.vertical]` section.
- Removed parameter ``\theta_{e}`` from SBM struct (not used in update). Parameters
  ``\theta_{s}`` and ``\theta_{r}`` included separately (instead of ``\theta_{e}``) in
  `LateralSSF struct`, now directly linked to SBM parameters.
- Improve error messages (NetCDF and cyclic flow graph).

### Added
- Export of NetCDF scalar timeseries (separate NetCDF file from gridded timeseries). This
  also allows for importing these timeseries by Delft-FEWS (General Adapter).

### Fixed
- Model parameter Manning's `n` now used during the update of the `struct SurfaceFlow`,
  to change the related ``\alpha`` parameter of the kinematic wave for channel flow.
