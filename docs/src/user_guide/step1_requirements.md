# Step 1: Understanding the requirements

In order to run wflow, several files are required. These consist of a settings file and
input data. The input data is typically separated into static maps and forcing data, both
are supplied in a netCDF file, except for lake storage and rating curves that are supplied
via CSV files. A brief overview of the different files:

 - The `settings.toml` file contains information on the simulation period, links to the
   input files (and their names in the netCDF files), and links the correct names of the
   variables in the netCDF files to the variables and parameters of wflow.
 - The `staticmaps.nc` file contains spatial information on the elevation, locations of the
   gauges, land-use, drainage direction, etc. This file can also contain maps with parameter
   values.
 - The `forcing.nc` file contains the precipitation, temperature and potential evaporation
   time series (as a 3D array).

There are several model configurations supported by wflow. These model configurations
require slightly different input requirements, yet the general structure is similar for each
model. A wflow model configuration consists of a `vertical` concept like the [SBM](@ref
vert_sbm), [HBV](@ref vert_hbv) or [FLEXTOPO](@ref vert_flextopo) in
combination with `lateral` concepts that control how water is routed for example over the
land or river domain. For the wflow\_sbm model different model configurations are possible.
The following model configurations are supported in wflow:

 - wflow\_sbm:
    - SBM + kinematic wave for subsurface and surface flow
    - SBM + kinematic wave for subsurface and overland flow + local inertial river (+
      optional floodplain)
    - SBM + kinematic wave for subsurface flow + local inertial river (1D) and land (2D)
    - SBM + groundwater flow + kinematic wave for surface flow
 - wflow\_hbv: HBV + kinematic wave for surface routing
 - wflow\_flextopo: FLEXTOPO + kinematic wave for surface routing
 - wflow\_sediment as post processing of wflow\_sbm or wflow\_hbv output

In the following pages, some examples will be given on how to prepare a basic wflow\_sbm
model. Example data for other model configurations is provided in the section with [sample
data](@ref sample_data).
