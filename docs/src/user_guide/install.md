# How to install

First download and install the [current stable release of
Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release). Please see [platform
specific instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) for further installation
instructions and if you have trouble installing Julia.

If you are new to Julia, it may be a good idea to check out the [Getting Started section of
the Julia Manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/). Links to other
learning resources can be found at
[julialang.org/learning](https://julialang.org/learning/).


Wflow can be used in two different ways, depending on the required use of the code:

- If you want to stay up-to-date with the latest version, explore and modify the model code,
  and write your own Julia scripts around the wflow package, we recommend installing wflow
  as a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package.
- If you don't need extra features, but just want to run simulations, a complied executable
  version is available. This consists of a single executable, `wflow_cli`, allowing you to
  run the model via the command line.

Below we describe how to install both versions of wflow.

## Installing as Julia package

Wflow is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package, that can be installed through several
different ways. Below we show how to install wflow from Julia's package repository, and
how to install the latest version from GitHub.

### Install from Julia's package repository

To access Julia's package manager, press `]` in the Julia REPL.  To get back to the Julia
REPL, press backspace or ^C.

!!! tip
    If you have not used Julia in a while, it can be a good idea to run `up` to update your
    packages.
    ```julia-repl
    pkg> up
    ```

Access Julia's package manager and install wflow using:
```julia-repl
pkg> add Wflow
```

This can take a while, especially the first time, since compatible dependencies are also
automatically looked up and installed from the Pkg General registry.

### Install from GitHub

It is also possible to install wflow from the `master` branch as follows:

```julia-repl
pkg> add Wflow#master
```

This command will track the `master` branch, and will update to the latest commit on that
branch when you run `update`, or simply `up`, in the Pkg REPL. The use of `add` will install
wflow in you home directory under `.julia/packages/Wflow`. Note that packages installed
under `packages` by `add` are supposed to never be altered in that location, for Pkg and
it's automatic dependency handling to work well.

If you want to make any changes to any of the files in the repository, you need to do
a development install. This can be done using:

```julia-repl
pkg> dev Wflow
```

This will clone the git repository, put it under your home directory in `.julia/dev/Wflow`,
and add the wflow package to your project environment. Note that to receive updates, you
have to pull in the latest changes yourself using `git pull`.

### Check installation of wflow

Finally, go back to the Julia REPL and try to load wflow:

```julia-repl
julia> using Wflow
```

The first time this will take longer as any package that is new or changed needs to be
pre-compiled first, to allow faster loading on subsequent uses. No error messages should
appear, indicating that you have now successfully installed wflow.

Before ending this section, we want to recommend a few tools that can make using and
developing Julia code easier.

!!! tip
    There is a section on editors and IDEs for Julia on <https://julialang.org/>, scroll
    down to see it. We use and recommend Microsoft's free and open source [Visual Studio
    Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). When combined with the [Julia
    extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) it provides a powerful and interactive
    development experience.

!!! tip
    When planning to make changes to the code of wflow, we recommend installing the `Revise.jl`
    package. This package allows you to modify code and use the changes without restarting
    Julia. Install it with `add Revise` from the Pkg REPL. Then create a file called
    `.julia/config/startup.jl`, and put `using Revise` there. This will load Revise every
    time you start a Julia session.

## Installing the compiled executable

Binaries of `wflow_cli` can be downloaded from our website
[download.deltares.nl](https://download.deltares.nl/en/download/wflow/), and are currently
available for Windows. Download and install the `.msi` file. After installing you can see
two folders in the installation directory. It is only the `bin/wflow_cli` that is used. The
artifacts folder contains binary dependencies such as netCDF.

```
artifacts\
bin\wflow_cli
```

Check whether the installation was performed successfully by running `wflow_cli` with no
arguments in the command line. This will give the following message:

```
Usage: wflow_cli 'path/to/config.toml'
```


!!! note
    The old version of wflow, based on Python and PCRaster libraries is also available to
    download from our website [download.deltares.nl](https://download.deltares.nl/en/download/wflow/).
    We recommend installing the Julia version, as this documentation is written to support
    this version.
