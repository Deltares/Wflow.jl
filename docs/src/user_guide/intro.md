# About the user guide

The purpose of this user guide is to describe the steps for installing the wflow Julia software
and setting up a simple model. The guide also includes a step-by-step process for 
configuring your model using the TOML file (model settings) and the netCDF gridded datasets.

Sample data and model setup are also provided for the Moselle River Basin (a major tributary
of the Rhine River), which can be used to explore the model software. The guide covers model setups 
for the `wflow\_sbm`, `wflow\_hbv` and `wflow\_sediment` model concepts.

Finally, the guide offers information on setting up your own model, including building a model
from scratch or alternatively using Deltares [HydroMT](https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt)
model building tools, which are open source.
