# About the user guide

The purpose of this user guide is to describe the steps to install the wflow julia software
and to set up a simple model. The user guide also contains a step-wise process how to
configure your model using the TOML file (model settings) and the netCDF gridded datasets.

Sample data and model set up is also included for the Moselle River Basin (a major tributary
of the Rhine River), which can be used to explore the model software. The model is set up
for the wflow\_sbm and wflow\_sediment model concepts.

Finally, information is provided on setting up your own model, including building a model
from scratch or alternatively using Deltares [HydroMT](https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt)
model building tools which are open source.
