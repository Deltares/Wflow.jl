# Inland sediment model
Over the land, soil erosion, also called soil loss, is closely linked to the water cycle.
The main processes governing sediment generation are splash erosion from rain droplets, and
sheet and rill erosion from the shear stress caused by overland flow. The intensity of soil
erosion by rain or ﬂow depends on the land and soil characteristics such as slope, land use
or soil type. Once soil is eroded, the detached particles can be transported downslope by
overland ﬂow. Along the transport pathways, soil particles can also be deposited due to a
low flow velocity, a change of topography in depressions, footslopes or valley bottoms,
and/or can be filtered and stopped by a change in vegetation such as ﬁeld boundaries.

The inland part of the sediment gathers these different processes, separated in a vertical
structure for the soil loss and lateral structure for the transport in overland flow.

## Soil Erosion
The first process to consider in sediment dynamics is the generation of sediments by land
erosion. The main processes behind soil loss are rainfall erosion and overland flow erosion.
In order to model such processes at a fine time and space scale, physics-based models such
as ANSWERS and EUROSEM were chosen here.

The choice of rainfall erosion method is set up in the model section of the TOML:
```toml
[model]
rainerosmethod = "answers" # Rainfall erosion equation: ["answers", "eurosem"]
```

### Rainfall erosion
In wflow\_sediment, rainfall erosion can both be modelled using EUROSEM or ANSWERS equation.
The main difference between the models is that EUROSEM uses a more physics-based approach
using the kinetic energy of the rain drops impacting the soil (Morgan et al, 1998), while
ANSWERS is more empirical and uses parameters from the USLE model (Beasley et al, 1991).

In EUROSEM, rainfall erosion is modelled according to rainfall intensity and its kinetic
energy while it reaches the soil according to equations developed by Brandt (1990). As the
intensity of the rain kinetic energy depends on the length of the fall, rainfall intercepted
by vegetation will then be reduced compared to direct throughfall. The kinetic energy of
direct throughfall is estimated by (Morgan et al, 1998):
```math 
   KE_{direct} = 8.95 + 8.44\,log_{10}\,R_{i}
```
where ``KE_{direct}`` is kinetic energy of direct throughfall (J m``^{-2}`` mm``^{-1}``) and
``R_{i}`` is rainfall intensity (mm h``^{-1}``). If the rainfall is intercepted by
vegetation and falls as leaf drainage, its kinetic energy is then reduced according to
(Brandt, 1990):
```math 
   KE_{leaf} = 15.8\,H_{p}^{0.5} - 5.87
```
where ``KE_{leaf}`` is kinetic energy of leaf drainage (J m``^{-2}`` mm``^{-1}``) and
``H_{p}`` is the effective canopy height (half of plant height in m). Canopy height can be
derived from the global map from Simard & al. (2011) or by user input depending on the land
use.

Kinetic energies from both direct throughfall and leaf drainage are then multiplied by the
respective depths of direct throughfall and leaf drainage (mm) and added to get the total
rainfall kinetic energy ``KE``. The soil detached by rainfall ``D_{R}`` (g m``^{-2}``) is
then:
```math 
   D_{R} = k\,KE\,e^{-\varphi h}
```
where ``k`` is an index of the detachability of the soil (g ``J^{-1}``), ``KE`` is the total
rainfall kinetic energy (J m``^{-2}``), ``h`` is the surface runoff depth on the soil (m)
and ``\varphi`` is an exponent varying between 0.9 and 3.1 used to reduce rainfall impact if
the soil is already covered by water. As a simplification, Torri (1987) has shown that a
value of 2.0 for ``\varphi`` is representative enough for a wide range of soil conditions.
The detachability of the soil ``k`` depends on the soil texture (proportion of clay, silt
and sand content) and corresponding values are defined in EUROSEM user guide (Morgan et al,
1998). As a simplification, in wflow\_sediment, the mean value of the detachability shown in
the table below are used. Soil texture can for example be derived from the topsoil clay and
silt content from SoilGrids (Hengl et al, 2017).

Table: Mean detachability of soil depending on its texture (Morgan et al, 1998).

| Texture (USDA system) | Mean detachability ``k`` (g/J) |
|:--------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Clay | 2.0 |
| Clay Loam | 1.7 |
| Silt | 1.2 |
| Silt Loam | 1.5 |
| Loam | 2.0 |
| Sandy Loam | 2.6 |
| Loamy Sand | 3.0 |
| Fine Sand | 3.5 |
| Sand | 1.9 |

Rainfall erosion is handled differently in ANSWERS. There, the impacts of vegetation and
soil properties are handled through the USLE coefficients in the equation (Beasley et al,
1991):
```math 
   D_{R} = 0.108 \, C_{USLE} \, K_{USLE} \, A_{i} \, R_{i}^{2}
```
where ``D_{R}`` is the soil detachment by rainfall (here in kg min``^{-1}``), ``C_{USLE}``
is the soil cover-management factor from the USLE equation, ``K_{USLE}`` is the soil
erodibility factor from the USLE equation, ``A_{i}`` is the area of the cell (m``^{2}``) and
``R_{i}`` is the rainfall intensity (here in mm min``^{-1}``). There are several methods
available to estimate the ``C`` and ``K`` factors from the USLE. They can come from user
input maps, for example maps resulting from Panagos & al.’s recent studies for Europe
(Panagos et al, 2015) (Ballabio et al, 2016). To get an estimate of the ``C`` factor
globally, the other method is to estimate ``C`` values for the different land use type in
from global land cover maps (e.g. GlobCover). An example is given for the global land cover
map GlobCover, summed up in the table below, the values come from a literature study
including Panagos et al.’s review (2015), Gericke & al. (2015), Mansoor & al. (2013), Chadli
et al. (2016), de Vente et al. (2009), Borrelli et al. (2014), Yang et al. (2003) and Bosco
et al. (2015).

The other methods to estimate the USLE ``K`` factor are to use either topsoil composition or
topsoil geometric mean diameter. ``K`` estimation from topsoil composition is estimated with
the equation developed in the EPIC model (Williams et al, 1983):
```math 
   K_{USLE} = \left\{ 0.2 + 0.3exp\left[-0.0256SAN\frac{(1-SIL)}{100}\right] \right\}
   \left(\frac{SIL}{CLA+SIL}\right)^{0.3} \\~\\
   \left(1-\frac{0.25OC}{OC+e^{(3.72-2.95OC)}}\right)\left(1-\frac{0.75SN}{SN+e^{(-5.51+22.9SN)}}\right)
```
where ``CLA``, ``SIL``, ``SAN`` are respectively the clay, silt and sand fractions of the
topsoil (%), ``OC`` is the topsoil organic carbon content (%) and ``SN`` is ``1-SAN/100``.
These soil parameters can be derived for example from the SoilGrids dataset. The ``K``
factor can also be estimated from the soil mean geometric diameter using the formulation
from the RUSLE guide by Renard & al. (1997):
```math 
   K_{USLE} = 0.0034 + 0.0405e^{\left(-\dfrac{1}{2}\left(\dfrac{log_{10}(D_{g})+1.659}{0.7101}\right)^{2}\right)}
```
where ``D_{g}`` is the soil geometric mean diameter (mm) estimated from topsoil clay, silt,
sand fraction.

| 230 | No data (burnt areas, clouds,…) | 0.0 |

### Overland flow erosion

Overland flow (or surface runoff) erosion is induced by the strength of the shear stress of
the surface water on the soil. As in rainfall erosion, the effect of the flow shear stress
can be reduced by the soil vegetation or by the soil properties. In wflow_sediment, soil
detachment by overland flow is modelled as in ANSWERS with (Beasley et al, 1991):
```math 
   D_{F} = 0.90 \, C_{USLE} \, K_{USLE} \, A_{i} \, S \, q
```
where ``D_{F}`` is soil detachment by flow (kg min``^{-1}``), ``C_{USLE}`` and ``K_{USLE}``
are the USLE cover and soil erodibility factors, ``A_{i}`` is the cell area (m``^{2}``),
``S`` is the slope gradient and ``q`` is the overland flow rate per unit width (m``^{2}``
min``^{-1}``). The USLE ``C`` and ``K`` factors can be estimated with the same methods as
for rainfall erosion and here the slope gradient is obtained from the sinus rather than the
tangent of the slope angle.

## Delivery to the river system
Once soil is detached, it can be transported by overland flow and reach the river system.
This process is described in [Sediment Flux in overland flow](@ref).
