# Vertical processes

## Snow and glaciers
Snow and glacier processes are derived from the original HBV concept and HBV-light
respectively. 

### Snow modelling

If the air temperature, ``T_a``, is below a user-defined threshold `tt` (``\degree``C)
precipitation occurs as snowfall, whereas it occurs as rainfall if ``Ta ≥ tt``. A another
parameter `tti` defines how precipitation can occur partly as rain of snowfall (see the
figure below). If precipitation occurs as snowfall, it is added to the dry snow component
within the snow pack. Otherwise it ends up in the free water reservoir, which represents the
liquid water content of the snow pack. Between the two components of the snow pack,
interactions take place, either through snow melt (if temperatures are above a threshold
`tt`) or through snow refreezing (if temperatures are below threshold `tt`.

The respective rates of snow melt and refreezing are:

```math
Q_m = cfmax(T_a−tt)\, ;\,T_a > tt \\~\\
Q_r=cfmax \, cfr(tt−T_a)\,;\, Ta < tt
```

where ``Q_m`` is the rate of snow melt, ``Q_r`` is the rate of snow refreezing, and
``cfmax`` and ``cfr`` are user defined model parameters (the melting factor
[mm/(``\degree``C day)] and the refreezing factor respectively).

The fraction of liquid water in the snow pack is at most equal to a user defined fraction,
`whc`, of the water equivalent of the dry snow content. If the liquid water concentration
exceeds `whc`, either through snow melt or incoming rainfall, the surpluss water
(`rainfall`) becomes available for infiltration into the soil:

```julia
    snowwater = snowwater - refreezing  # free water content in snow
    maxsnowwater = snow * whc  # max water in the snow
    snowwater = snowwater + snowmelt + rainfall  # add all water and potentially supersaturate the snowpack
    rainfall = max(snowwater - maxsnowwater, 0.0)  # rain + surpluss snowwater
```

### Glacier modelling
Glacier processes can be modelled if the snow model is enabled. For the vertical HBV concept
snow modelling is not optional. Glacier modelling is very close to snow modelling and
considers two main processes: glacier build-up from snow turning into firn/ice (using the
HBV-light model) and glacier melt (using a temperature degree-day model).

The definition of glacier boundaries and initial volume is defined in three parameters.
`glacierfrac` is a parameter that gives the fraction of each grid cell covered by a glacier
as a number between zero and one. `glacierstore` is a state parameter that gives the amount
of water (in mm w.e.) within the glaciers at each gridcell. Because the glacier store
(`glacierstore`) cannot be initialized by running the model for a couple of years, a default
initial state should be supplied by adding this parameter to the input static file. The
required glacier data can be prepared from available glacier datasets.

First, a fixed fraction of the snowpack on top of the glacier is converted into ice for each
timestep and added to the `glacierstore` using the HBV-light model (Seibert et al., 2018).
This fraction `g_sifrac` typically ranges from 0.001 to 0.006.

Then, when the snowpack on top of the glacier is almost all melted (snow cover < 10 mm),
glacier melt is enabled and estimated with a degree-day model. If the air temperature,
``T_a``, is below a certain threshold `g_tt` (``\degree``C) precipitation occurs as
snowfall, whereas it occurs as rainfall if ``T_a ≥`` `g_tt`.

With this the rate of glacier melt in mm is estimated as:

```math
Q_m = g\_cfmax(T_a − g\_tt)\, ; \, T_a > g\_tt
```

where ``Q_m`` is the rate of glacier melt and ``g\_cfmax`` is the melting factor in
mm/(``\degree``C day). Parameter `g_tt` can be taken as equal to the snow `tt` parameter.
Values of the melting factor `g_cfmax` normally varies from one glacier to another and some
values are reported in the literature. `g_cfmax` can also be estimated by multiplying snow
`cfmax` by a factor between 1 and 2, to take into account the higher albedo of ice compared
to snow.

## Rainfall interception
Both the Gash and Rutter models are available to estimate rainfall interception by the
vegetation. The selection of an interception model depends on the simulation timestep.

### The analytical (Gash) model
The analytical model of rainfall interception is based on Rutter’s numerical model. The
simplifications that introduced allow the model to be applied on a daily basis, although a
storm-based approach will yield better results in situations with more than one storm per
day. The amount of water needed to completely saturate the canopy is defined as:

```math
P'=\frac{-\overline{R}S}{\overline{E}_{w}}ln\left[1-\frac{\overline{E}_{w}}{\overline{R}}(1-p-p_{t})^{-1}\right]
```

where ``\overline{R}`` is the average precipitation intensity on a saturated canopy and
``\overline{E}_{w}`` the average evaporation from the wet canopy and with the vegetation
parameters ``S``, ``p`` and ``p_t`` as defined previously. The model uses a series of
expressions to calculate the interception loss during different phases of a storm. An
analytical integration of the total evaporation and rainfall under saturated canopy
conditions is then done for each storm to determine average values of ``\overline{E}_{w}``
and ``\overline{R}``. The total evaporation from the canopy (the total interception loss) is
calculated as the sum of the components listed in the table below. Interception losses from
the stems are calculated for days with ``P\geq S_{t}/p_{t}``. ``p_t`` and ``S_t`` are small
and neglected.

Table: Formulation of the components of interception loss according to Gash:

| Components  | Interception loss |
|:----------- | ----------------- |
| For ``m`` small storms (``P_{g}<{P'}_{g}``)    | ``(1-p-p_{t})\sum_{j=1}^{m}P_{g,j}`` | 
| Wetting up the canopy in ``n`` large storms (``P_{g}\geq{P'}_{g}``)     | ``n(1-p-p_{t}){P'}_{g}-nS`` | 
| Evaporation from saturated canopy during rainfall | ``\overline{E}/\overline{R}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(P_{g,j}-{P'}_{g})``|
| Evaporation after rainfall ceases for ``n`` large storms | ``nS`` |
| Evaporation from trunks in ``q`` storms that fill the trunk storage | ``qS_{t}`` |
| Evaporation from  trunks in ``m+n-q`` storms that do not fill the trunk storage | ``p_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{m+n-q}P_{g,j}`` | 

In applying the analytical model, saturated conditions are assumed to occur when the hourly
rainfall exceeds a certain threshold. Often a threshold of 0.5 mm/hr is used.
``\overline{R}`` is calculated for all hours when the rainfall exceeds the threshold to give
an estimate of the mean rainfall rate onto a saturated canopy.

Gash (1979) has shown that in a regression of interception loss on rainfall (on a storm
basis) the regression coefficient should equal to ``\overline{E}_w/\overline{R}``. Assuming
that neither ``\overline{E}_w`` nor ``\overline{R}`` vary considerably in time,
``\overline{E}_w`` can be estimated in this way from ``\overline{R}`` in the absence of
above-canopy climatic observations. Values derived in this way generally tend to be (much)
higher than those calculated with the penman-monteith equation.

### The modified rutter model
For subdaily timesteps the interception is caclulated using a simplification of the Rutter
model. The simplified model is solved explicitly and does not take drainage from the canopy
into account.

## Interception parameters from LAI
The SBM concept can determine the interception parameters from leaf area index (LAI)
climatology. In order to switch this on you must define this cyclic parameter in the TOML
file, the parameter is read from `path_static`, as follows:

```toml
[input] 
path_forcing = "data/forcing-moselle.nc" 
path_static = "data/staticmaps-moselle.nc"

cyclic = ["vertical.leaf_area_index"]
```
Furtermore these additional parameters are required:
+ Specific leaf storage  (`sl` \[mm\])
+ Storage woody part of vegetation (`swood` \[mm\])
+ Extinction coefficient (`kext` \[-\])

Here it is assumed that `cmax` \[mm\] (leaves) (canopy storage capacity for the leaves only)
relates linearly with LAI (c.f. Van Dijk and Bruijnzeel 2001). This done via the `sl`. `sl`
can be determined through a lookup table with land cover based on literature (Pitman 1989,
Lui 1998). Next the `cmax` (leaves) is determined using:

```math

    cmax(leaves)  = sl \, LAI
```
To get to total storage (`cmax`) the woody part of the vegetation also needs to be added. As
for `sl`, the storage of the woody part `swood` can also be related to land cover (lookup
table).

The canopy gap fraction is determined using the extinction coefficient `kext` (van Dijk and
Bruijnzeel 2001):

```math
    canopygapfraction = exp(-kext \, LAI)
```

The extinction coefficient `kext` can be related to land cover.
