# SBM vertical concept

The SBM vertical concept has its roots in the Topog\_SBM model but has had considerable
changes over time. The main differences are:

- The unsaturated zone can be split-up in different layers
- The addition of evapotranspiration losses
- The addition of a capillary rise

The sections below describe the working of the SBM vertical concept in more detail.

## Snow
Snow modelling is enabled by specifying the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
snow = true
```

The snow model is described in [Snow modelling](@ref)

## Glaciers
Glacier processes are described in [Glacier modelling](@ref). Glacier modelling is enabled
by specifying the following in the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
glacier = true
```

## Soil
### Infiltration
If the surface is (partly) saturated the throughfall and stemflow that falls onto the
saturated area is added to the river runoff component (based on fraction rivers,
`riverfrac`) and to the overland runoff component (based on open water fraction
(`waterfrac`) minus `riverfrac`). Infiltration of the remaining water is determined as
follows:

The soil infiltration capacity can be adjusted in case the soil is frozen, this is optional
and can be set in the TOML file as follows:

```toml
[model]
soilinfreduction = true 
```
The remaining storage capacity of the unsaturated store is determined.  The infiltrating
water is split in two parts, the part that falls on compacted areas and the part that falls
on non-compacted areas. The maximum amount of water that can infiltrate in these areas is
calculated by taking the minimum of the maximum infiltration rate (`infiltcapsoil` for
non-compacted areas and `infiltcappath` for compacted areas) and the water on these areas.
The water that can actual infiltrate is calculated by taking the minimum of the total
maximum infiltration rate (compacted and non-compacted areas) and the remaining storage
capacity.

Infiltration excess occurs when the infiltration capacity is smaller then the throughfall
and stemflow rate. This amount of water (`infiltexcess`) becomes overland flow (infiltration
excess overland flow). Saturation excess occurs when the (upper) soil becomes saturated and
water cannot infiltrate anymore. This amount of water (`excesswater` and `exfiltwater`)
becomes overland flow (saturation excess overland flow).

### The SBM soil water accounting scheme
A detailed description of the Topog\_SBM model has been given by Vertessy (1999). Briefly:
the soil is considered as a bucket with a certain depth (``z_{t}``), divided into a
saturated store (``S``) and an unsaturated store (``U``), the magnitudes of which are
expressed in units of depth. The top of the ``S`` store forms a pseudo-water table at depth
``z_{i}`` such that the value of ``S`` at any time is given by:
```math 
    S=(z_{t}-z_{i})(\theta_{s}-\theta_{r})
```
where ``\theta_{s}`` and ``\theta_{r}`` are the saturated and residual soil water contents,
respectively. 

The unsaturated store (``U``) is subdivided into storage (``U_{s}``) and deficit (``U_{d}``)
which are again expressed in units of depth:
```math
    U_{d}=(\theta_{s}-\theta_{r})z_{i}-U\\
    U_{s}=U-U_{d}
```
The saturation deficit (``S_{d}``) for the soil profile as a whole is defined as: 

```math
    S_{d}=(\theta_{s}-\theta_{r})z_{t}-S
```

All infiltrating water that enters the ``U`` store first. The unsaturated layer can be
split-up in different layers, by providing the thickness [mm] of the layers in the TOML
file. The following example specifies three layers (from top to bottom) of 100, 300 and 800
mm: 

```toml
[model]
thicknesslayers = [100, 300, 800]
```
The code checks for each grid cell the specified layers against the `soilthickness`, and
adds or removes (partly) layer(s) based on the `soilthickness`.

Assuming a unit head gradient, the transfer of water (``st``) from a ``U`` store layer is
controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity ``K_{sat}`` at depth ``z`` (bottom layer)
or :math:`z_{i}`, the effective saturation degree of the layer, and a Brooks-Corey power
coefficient (parameter ``c``) based on the pore size distribution index ``\lambda`` (Brooks
and Corey (1964)):

```math
    st=K_{\mathit{sat}}\left(\frac{\theta-\theta_{r}}{\theta_{s}-\theta_{r}}\right)^{c}\\~\\
    c=\frac{2+3\lambda}{\lambda}
```
When the unsaturated layer is not split-up into different layers, it is possible to use the
original Topog\_SBM vertical transfer formulation, by specifying in the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
transfermethod = true
```
The transfer of water from the ``U`` store to the ``S`` store (``st``) is in that case
controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity ``K_{sat}`` at depth ``z_{i}`` and the
ratio between ``U`` and ``S_{d}``: 

```math
    st=K_{\mathit{sat}}\frac{U_{s}}{S_{d}}
```
Saturated conductivity (``K_{sat}``) declines with soil depth (``z``) in the model according
to: 

```math
    K_{sat}=K_{0}e^{(-fz)}
```
where ``K_{0}`` is the saturated conductivity at the soil surface and ``f`` is a scaling
parameter [mm``^{-1}``]. The scaling parameter :math:`f` is defined by:

```math
f=\frac{\theta_{s}-\theta_{r}}{M} 
```
with ``\theta_{s}`` and ``\theta_{r}`` as defined previously and ``M`` [mm] representing a
model parameter.

## Transpiration and soil evaporation
The potential eveporation left over after interception and open water evaporation (rivers
and water bodies) is split in potential soil evaporation and potential transpiration based
on the canopy gap fraction (assumed to be identical to the amount of bare soil).

For the case of one single soil layer, soil evaporation is scaled according to:

    soilevapunsat = potsoilevap * min(1.0, saturationdeficit / sbm.soilwatercapacity[i])
 

As such, evaporation will be potential if the soil is fully wetted and it decreases linear
with increasing soil moisture deficit.

For more than one soil layer, soil evaporation is only provided from the upper soil layer
(often 100 mm) and soil evaporation is split in evaporation from the unsaturated store and
evaporation from the saturated store. First water is evaporated water from the unsaturated
store. Then the remaining potential soil evaporation can be used for evaporation from the
saturated store. This is only possible, when the water table is present in the upper soil
layer (very wet conditions). Both the evaporation from the unsaturated store and the
evaporation from the saturated store are limited by the minimum of the remaining potential
soil evaporation and the available water in the unsaturated/saturated zone of the upper soil
layer. Also for multiple soil layers, the evaporation (both unsaturated and saturated)
decreases linearly with decreasing water availability.

The original Topog\_SBM model does not include transpiration or a notion of capillary rise.
In SBM transpiration is first taken from the ``S`` store if the roots reach the water table
``z_{i}``. If the ``S`` store cannot satisfy the demand the ``U`` store is used next. First
the number of wet roots is determined (going from 1 to 0) using a sigmoid function as
follows:

```math
    wetroots = 1.0/(1.0 + e^{-rootdistpar (zi - rootindepth)})
```

Here the sharpness parameter `rootdistpar` (by default a large negative value, -500.0)
determines if there is a stepwise output or a more gradual output (default is stepwise).
`zi` [mm] is the level of the water table in the grid cell below the surface, `rootindepth`
[mm] is the maximum depth of the roots below the surface. For all values of `zi` smaller
that `rootindepth` a value of 1 is returned if they are equal a value of 0.5 is returned if
`zi` is larger than the `rootindepth` a value of 0 is returned. The returned `wetroots`
fraction is multiplied by the potential evaporation (and limited by the available water in
saturated zone) to get the transpiration from the saturated part of the soil:

        # transpiration from saturated store
        wetroots = scurve(sbm.zi[i], a = rootingdepth, c = sbm.rootdistpar[i])
        actevapsat = min(pottrans * wetroots, satwaterdepth)
        satwaterdepth = satwaterdepth - actevapsat
        restpottrans = pottrans - actevapsat

Next the remaining potential evaporation is used to extract water from the unsaturated
store. The fraction of roots (`availcap`) that cover the unsaturated zone for each soil
layer is used to calculate the potential root water extraction rate (`maxextr`):

    maxextr = availcap * ustorelayerdepth

When `whole_ust_available` is set to true in the TOML file as follows, the complete
unsaturated storage is available for transpiration:

```toml
[model]
whole_ust_available = true
```

Next, the Feddes root water uptake reduction model (Feddes et al., 1978) is used to
calculate a reduction coefficient as a function of soil water pressure. Soil water pressure
is calculated following Brooks and Corey (1964):

```math
    \frac{(\theta-\theta_r)}{(\theta_s-\theta_r)} =  \Bigg\lbrace{\left(\frac{h_b}{h}\right)^{\lambda}, h > h_b \atop 1 , h \leq h_b}
```
where ``h`` is the pressure head (cm), ``h_b`` is the air entry pressure head, and
``\theta``, ``\theta_s``, ``\theta_r`` and ``\lambda`` as previously defined.

Feddes (1978) described a transpiration reduction-curve for the reduction coefficient
``\alpha``, as a function of ``h``.

Below, the function used in SBM, that calculates actual transpiration from the unsaturated
zone layer(s).

```@docs
Wflow.acttransp_unsat_sbm(rootingdepth, ustorelayerdepth, sumlayer, restpotevap, sum_actevapustore, c, usl, θₛ, θᵣ, hb, ust::Bool = false)
```

Capillary rise is determined using the following approach: first ``K_{sat}`` is determined
at the water table ``z_{i}``; next a potential capillary rise is determined from the minimum
of the ``K_{sat}``, the actual transpiration taken from the ``U`` store, the available water
in the ``S`` store and the deficit of the ``U`` store. Finally the potential rise is scaled
using the distance between the roots and the water table using:

```math
CSF=CS/(CS+z_{i}-RT)
```
in which ``CSF`` is the scaling factor to multiply the potential rise with, ``CS`` is a
model parameter (default = 100) and ``RT`` the rooting depth. If the roots reach the water
table (``RT > z_{i}``) ``CS`` is set to zero thus setting the capillary rise to zero.

## Leakage
If the `maxleakage` parameter is set > 0, water is lost from the saturated zone and runs out
of the model.

## Soil temperature
The near surface soil temperature is modelled using a simple equation (Wigmosta et al.,
2009):

```math
T_s^{t} = T_s^{t-1} + w  (T_a - T_s^{t-1})  
```
where ``T_s^{t}`` is the near-surface soil temperature at time ``t``, ``T_a`` is air
temperature and ``w`` is a weighting coefficient determined through calibration (default is
0.1125 for daily timesteps).

A reduction factor (`cf_soil`, default is 0.038) is applied to the maximum infiltration rate
(`infiltcapsoil` and `infiltcappath`), when the following model settings are specified in
the TOML file:

```toml
[model]
soilinfreduction = true
snow = true
```
A S-curve is used to make a smooth transition (a c-factor (``c``) of 8.0 is used):

```math 
    b = \frac{1.0}{(1.0 - cf\_soil)}\\~\\
    soilinfredu = \frac{1.0}{b + exp(-c (T_s - a))} + cf\_soil\\~\\
    a = 0.0\\
    c = 8.0
```
