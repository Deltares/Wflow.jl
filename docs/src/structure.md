# Model structure

```julia
struct Model{N,L,V,R,W}
    config::Config  # all configuration options
    network::N      # connectivity information, directed graph
    lateral::L      # lateral model that holds lateral state, moves along network
    vertical::V     # vertical model that holds vertical state, independent of each other
    clock::Clock    # to keep track of simulation time
    reader::R       # provides the model with dynamic input
    writer::W       # writes model output
end
```
## Config and TOML

[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) is used as the configuration format for models
available in wflow. File paths included in the configuration TOML file are relative to the
TOML file location. 

### General time info
First information about time is provided in the TOML file, with an example below. A
`starttime`, `endtime` and the model time step `timestepsecs` is required. The `calendar`
and `time_units` optional information is used by the `writer` of the model, for model output
in netCDF format.

```toml
casename = "testcase"                           # optional

calendar = "proleptic_gregorian"                # optional, this is default value
endtime = 2000-02-01T00:00:00                   # required 
starttime = 2000-01-01T00:00:00                 # required
time_units = "days since 1900-01-01 00:00:00"   # optional, this is default value
timestepsecs = 86400                            # required
```

### Model section
Model specific settings can be included in the model section of the TOML file.

```toml
[model]
type = "sbm"                        # one of ("sbm", "sbm_gwf, "hbv")
masswasting = true                  # include lateral snow transport in the model, default is false
snow = true                         # include snow modelling, default is false
reinit = true                       # cold (reinit = true) or warm state (reinit = false), default is true
reservoirs = true                   # include reservoir modelling, default is false
kin_wave_iteration = true           # enable kinematic wave iterations in the model, default is false
thicknesslayers = [100, 300, 800]   # specific SBM setting: for each soil layer a thickness [mm] is specified
```

### State section
The `state` section in the TOML file provides information about the location of the state
file if the model is initialized with a warm state (`path_input`) and to what file the
states are written at the end of the model run (`path_output`). A mapping between external
state names and internal model states is required. This information is specified for each
model component, the `vertical` model and `lateral` model components. In the example below
the `vertical` component represents the SBM concept, and for the `lateral` components there
is a `river` (including `reservoir`), `land` and `subsurface` domain. The internal model
states are listed on the left side, and the external state names are listed on the right
side.

```toml
[state]
path_input = "data/instates-moselle.nc" 
path_output = "data/outstates-moselle.nc"

[state.vertical]
satwaterdepth = "satwaterdepth"
snow = "snow"
tsoil = "tsoil"
ustorelayerdepth = "ustorelayerdepth"
snowwater = "snowwater"
canopystorage = "canopystorage"

[state.lateral.river]
q = "q_river"
h = "h_river"
h_av = "h_av_river"

[state.lateral.river.reservoir]
volume = "volume_reservoir"

[state.lateral.subsurface]
ssf = "ssf"

[state.lateral.land]
q = "q_land"
h = "h_land"
h_av = "h_av_land"
```
### Input section
The `input` section of the TOML file contains information about the input forcing and model
parameters files (netCDF format). Forcing is applied to the vertical component of the model,
and needs to be mapped to the external netCDF variable name. `forcing` lists the internal
model forcing parameters, and these are mapped to the external netCDF variables listed under
the section `[input.vertical]`. It is possible to provide cyclic parameters to the model. In
the example below this is done for the internal `vertical.leaf_area_index` model parameter,
that is linked to the external netCDF variable "LAI" variable. 

As for the states, mapping of external model parameters (provided in the example below by
the file staticmaps-moselle.nc) is done per model component. If a model parameter is not
mapped a default value will be used if available.

```toml
[input]
path_forcing = "data/forcing-moselle.nc"
path_static = "data/staticmaps-moselle.nc"

# these are not directly part of the model
gauges = "wflow_gauges"
ldd = "wflow_ldd"
river_location = "wflow_river"
subcatchment = "wflow_subcatch"

# specify the internal IDs of the parameters which vary over time
# the external name mapping needs to be below together with the other mappings
forcing = [
"vertical.precipitation",
"vertical.temperature",
"vertical.potential_evaporation",
]

cyclic = ["vertical.leaf_area_index"]

[input.vertical]
altitude = "wflow_dem" 
c = "c" 
cf_soil = "cf_soil" 
cfmax = "Cfmax" 
e_r = "EoverR" 
infiltcappath = "InfiltCapPath" 
infiltcapsoil = "InfiltCapSoil" 
kext = "Kext" 
"kv₀" = "KsatVer" 
leaf_area_index = "LAI"
m = "M" 
maxleakage = "MaxLeakage" 
pathfrac = "PathFrac" 
potential_evaporation = "PET" # forcing
precipitation = "P" # forcing
rootdistpar = "rootdistpar" 
rootingdepth = "RootingDepth" 
soilminthickness = "SoilMinThickness" 
soilthickness = "SoilThickness" 
specific_leaf = "Sl" 
storage_wood = "Swood" 
temperature = "TEMP" # forcing
tt = "TT" 
tti = "TTI" 
ttm = "TTM" 
w_soil = "wflow_soil" 
water_holding_capacity = "WHC" 
waterfrac = "WaterFrac" 
"θᵣ" = "thetaR" 
"θₛ" = "thetaS"

[input.lateral.river]
length = "wflow_riverlength"
n = "N_River"
slope = "RiverSlope"
width = "wflow_riverwidth"

[input.lateral.river.reservoir]
area = "ResSimpleArea"
areas = "wflow_reservoirareas"
demand = "ResDemand"
locs = "wflow_reservoirlocs"
maxrelease = "ResMaxRelease"
maxvolume = "ResMaxVolume"
targetfullfrac = "ResTargetFullFrac"
targetminfrac = "ResTargetMinFrac"

[input.lateral.subsurface]
ksathorfrac = "KsatHorFrac"

[input.lateral.land]
n = "N"
slope = "Slope"
```

### Output netCDF section

This section of the TOML file contains the output netCDF file for writing gridded model
output, including a mapping between internal model parameter components and external netCDF
variables.  

```toml
[output]
path = "data/output_moselle.nc"

[output.vertical]
satwaterdepth = "satwaterdepth"
snow = "snow"
tsoil = "tsoil"
ustorelayerdepth = "ustorelayerdepth"
snowwater = "snowwater"
canopystorage = "canopystorage"

[output.lateral.river]
q = "q_river"
h = "h_river"

[output.lateral.river.reservoir]
volume = "volume_reservoir"

[output.lateral.subsurface]
ssf = "ssf"

[output.lateral.land]
q = "q_land"
h = "h_land"
```

### Output CSV section
Model output can also be written to CSV output. Below is an example that writes model output
to the file "output_moselle.csv". For each CSV column a `header` and `parameter` (internal
model parameter) is required. A `reducer` can be specified to apply to the model output,
with the following available reducers:

+ maximum
+ minimum
+ mean
+ median
+ first
+ last
+ only

with `only` as the default. To extract data for a specific location (grid cell), the `index`
of the vector, the coordinates `coordinate.x` and `coordinate.y`, or the x and y indices of
the 2D array (`index.x` and `index.y`) can be provided. Finally a `map` can be provided to
extract data for certain locations (e.g. `gauges`) or areas (e.g. `subcatchment`).



```toml
[csv]
path = "data/output_moselle.csv"

[[csv.column]]
header = "Q"
parameter = "lateral.river.q"
reducer = "maximum"

[[csv.column]]
header = "volume"
index = 1
parameter = "lateral.river.reservoir.volume"

[[csv.column]]
coordinate.x = 6.255
coordinate.y = 50.012
header = "temp_bycoord"
parameter = "vertical.temperature"

[[csv.column]]
header = "temp_byindex"
index.x = 100
index.y = 50
parameter = "vertical.temperature"

[[csv.column]]
header = "Q"
map = "gauges"
parameter = "lateral.river.q"

[[csv.column]]
header = "recharge"
map = "subcatchment"
parameter = "vertical.recharge"
reducer = "mean"
```
