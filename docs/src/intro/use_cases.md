## [Wflow models for the Meuse and Rhine](@id case_rws)

Reliable hydrological models for the Rhine and the Meuse river basin are necessary for
short-term forecasting of river flows and long-term predictions for strategic water management
planning. In collaboration with Rijkswaterstaat, Deltares is setting-up a new line of models
for the Rhine and the Meuse basins. The models will be used for forecasting and to estimate the
impact of climate change on water resources and extreme streamflow. In the model development,
we seek to improve hydrological predictions by including relevant processes in the model
schematization. The modularity of the wflow framework is ideal for this as we can easily
evaluate the combination of different vertical and lateral model components. For example, the
local inertial routing for river and overland flow enables us to consider retention of water in
the floodplains, which will likely improve extreme streamflow predictions.

## [Operational flood forecasting in Australia](@id case_flifs)

In Australia, there was a need for high-resolution, fast and accurate rainfall-runoff models to
provide boundary conditions for a fast and detailled flood inundation model (SFINCS). The
domain of the flood model covers there complete North and East coast of Australia. Although
many observations stations are available to provide real-time information, many rivers are not
covered. For these locations, wflow\_sbm models are used to provide this real-time information.
Additionally, these models are used to provide projections for potential future scenarios.
Using the HydroMT library, all wflow\_sbm models were automatically build. The high level of
flexibility in spatial and temporal resolution, and the physically based nature of the concept
make wflow\_sbm a very suitable model for ungauged basins. Furthermore, the model is both
detailled and computationally efficient enough in order to be coupled to the fast flood
inundation model SFINCS.

The results of this Proof of Concept are very promising. Technically, we were able to very
quickly setup the wflow\_sbm models, couple them to the flood inundation models (SFINCS) and
run the models operationally under the Delft-FEWS platform. For two basins, model validation
was caried out, by comparing the results of wflow\_sbm against the observations and the results
of calibrated URBS models. This validation showed that the uncalibrated wflow\_sbm model
results were already quite satisfying, especially given the complex nature of these basins,
including several small and big reservoirs. We could also demonstrate the potential for further
calibration by changing the KsatHorFrac parameter.

## [Simulating plastic transport in Thailand](@id case_mfa)

For the Polution Control Board of the Government of Thailand and The World Bank, we supported
the material flow analysis of plastics in Thailand using wflow. Plastic polution is a growing
problem globally. Plastic waste enters the rivers and is transported to the ocean where it
remains and threatens the health of the ocean, seas and coasts. The initial movement of plastic
waste is in many cases triggered by runoff from (heavy) rainfall and with the flow of water
transported towards the small stream and rivers. Therefore there is strong relation to
rainfall-runoff processes, which allows also to model this process using high-resolution
rainfall-runoff models.

In this study we applied the wflow\_sbm model in combination with a fate-and-transport and
water quality model (DelWaq) to simulate the movement of plastics through 5 large river basins
and on 3 island and coastal zones (Krabi, Phuket and Ko Samui, see screenshot of the model
below) in Thailand. Together with our partners Panya Consultants and HII, we were able to show
hotspots of plastic polution, how much plastic waste would end up in the Gulf of Thailand and
what would be priority areas to adress to reduce plastic waste reaching the sea.

The wflow\_sbm models for the 5 large basins were calibrated. The presence of large dams and
reservoirs complicated the calibration, but with the input for the operation of the dams, the
model performance for these basins could be largely improved. The figure below shows the
calibrated model results for the Chao Phraya, just upstream of Bangkok. The input from the
hydrological wflow\_sbm model was used as input for the fate and transport model to assess how
much plastic would transported to the ocean.
