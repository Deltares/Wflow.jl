# Wflow

Wflow is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package that provides a hydrological modeling
framework, as well as several different vertical and lateral concepts that can be used to
run hydrological simulations. It is a continuation of the work available
[here](https://github.com/openstreams/wflow).
