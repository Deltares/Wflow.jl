# Wflow

Wflow is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package that provides a hydrological modeling
framework, as well as several different vertical and lateral concepts that can be used to
run hydrological simulations.

This is an in development version of wflow, a continuation of the work available
[here](https://github.com/openstreams/wflow). We will make a first release later this year.
