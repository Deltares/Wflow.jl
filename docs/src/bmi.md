# Basic Model Interface

## Introduction
The [Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page)
(CSMDS) has developed the Basic Model Interface (BMI). BMI consists of a set of standard
control and query functions that can be added by a developer to the model code and makes a
model both easier to learn and easier to couple with other software elements.

CSDMS provides specifications for the languages C, C++, Fortran and Python. `Wflow`, written
in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/), makes use of the following
[Julia specification](https://github.com/Deltares/BasicModelInterface.jl), based on BMI 2.0
version.

For the BMI implementation of `Wflow` all grids are defined as [unstructured
grids](https://bmi-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_grids.html#unstructured-grids). While
the input (forcing and model parameters) is structured (uniform rectilinear), internally
wflow works with one dimensional arrays based on the active grid cells of the 2D model
domain.

## Configuration
The variables that `Wflow` can exchange through BMI are based on the different model
components and these components should be listed under the `API` section of the TOML
configuration file of the model type. Below an example of this `API` section, that lists the
`vertical` component and different `lateral` components:

```toml
[API]
components = [
  "vertical",
  "lateral.subsurface",
  "lateral.land",
  "lateral.river",
  "lateral.river.reservoir"
]
```
