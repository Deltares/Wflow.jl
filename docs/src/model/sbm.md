# wflow\_sbm

Wflow\_sbm represents a family of hydrological models that derived from the CQflow model
(Köhler et al.,2006) that has been applied in various countries, most notably in Central
America. The models have the vertical SBM concept in common. The soil part of wflow\_sbm is
largely based on the Topog\_SBM model but has had considerable changes over time. Topog\_SBM
is specifically designed to simulate fast runoff processes in small catchments while
wflow\_sbm model can be applied more widely. The main differences are for the vertical
concept SBM of wflow\_sbm:

- The unsaturated zone can be split-up in different layers
- The addition of evapotranspiration losses
- The addition of a capillary rise

The vertical SBM concept is explained in more detail in [SBM vertical concept](@ref).

Topog\_SBM uses an element network based on contour lines and trajectories for water
routing. Wflow\_sbm models differ in how the lateral components:
- river
- land
- subsurface  

are solved.

## SBM + Kinematic wave
For the lateral components of this wflow\_sbm model water is routed over a D8 network, and
the kinematic wave approach is used for river, overland and lateral subsurface flow. This is
described in more detail [Kinematic wave](@ref).

## SBM + Groundwater flow
For river and overland flow the kinematic wave approach over a D8 network is used for this
wflow\_sbm model. For the subsurface domain, an unconfined aquifer with groundwater flow in
four directions (adjacent cells) is used. This is described in more detail [Groundwater
flow](@ref).
