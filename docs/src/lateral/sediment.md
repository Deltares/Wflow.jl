# Sediment Flux

Both the inland and river sediment model take into account sediment flux or transport of
sediment in water, either in overland flow or in the stream flow. These two transport are
distinguished in two different strucutures.

## Inland Sediment Model

### Sediment Flux in overland flow
Once the amount of soil detached by both rainfall and overland flow has been estimated, it has 
then to be routed and delivered to the river network. Inland routing in sediment models is usually 
done by comparing the amount of detached sediment with the transport capacity of the flow, which is 
the maximum amount of sediment than the flow can carry downslope. There are several existing formulas 
available in the literature. For a wide range of slope and for overland flow, the Govers equation (1990) 
seems the most appropriate choice (Hessel et al, 2007). However, as the wflow_sediment model was 
developed to be linked to water quality issues, the Yalin transport equation was chosen as it can handle
particle differentiation  (Govers equation can still be used if wflow_sediment is used to only
model inland processes with no particle differentiation). For land cells, wflow_sediment assumes
that erosion can mobilize 5 classes of sediment:

- Clay (mean diameter of 2 ``\mu``m)
- Silt (mean diameter of 10 ``\mu``m)
- Sand (mean diameter of 200 ``\mu``m)
- Small aggregates (mean diameter of 30 ``\mu``m)
- Large aggregates (mean diameter of 500 ``\mu``m).

```math 
   PSA = SAN *(1-CLA)^{2.4}
   PSI = 0.13SIL
   PCL = 0.20CLA
   SAG = 2.0CLA for CLA < 0.25 
   SAG = 0.28(CLA-0.25)+0.5 for  0.25 \leq CLA \leq 0.5
   SAG = 0.57 for CLA > 0.5
   LAG = 1 - PSA - PSI - PCL - SAG
```
where ``CLA``, ``SIL`` and ``SAN`` are the primary clay, silt, sand fractions 
of the topsoil and ``PCL``, ``PSI``, ``PSA``, ``SAG`` and ``LAG`` are 
the clay, silt, sand, small and large aggregates fractions of the detached sediment respectively.
The transport capacity of the flow using Yalin’s equation with particle differentiation, 
developed by Foster (1982), is:
```math 
   TC_{i} = (P_{e})_{i} * (S_{g})_{i} *\rho_{w} * g * d_{i} * V_{*}
```
where ``TC_{i}`` is the transport capacity of the flow for the particle class i, 
``(P_{e})_{i}`` is the effective number of particles of class i, ``(S_{g})_{i}`` 
is the specific gravity for the particle class i (kg m``^{-3}``), ``\rho_{w}`` 
is the mass density of the fluid (kg m``^{-3}``), ``g`` is the acceleration 
due to gravity (m s``^{-2}``), ``d_{i}`` is the diameter of the particle of 
class i (m) and ``V_{*}=(g* R * S)^{0.5}`` is the shear velocity of the flow
(m s``^{-1}``) with ``S`` the slope gradient and ``R`` the hydraulic radius 
of the flow (m). The detached sediment are then routed downslope until the river network 
using the accucapacityflux, accupacitystate functions
depending on the transport capacity from Yalin.

The choice of transport capacity method for the overland flow is set up in the model section of the TOML:
```toml
[model]
landtransportmethod = "yalinpart" # Overland flow transport capacity method: ["yalinpart", "govers", "yalin"]
```
Note that the "govers" and "yalin" equations can only assess total transport capacity of the flow and can
therefore not be used in combination with the river part of the sediment model.

## River Sediment Model

Sediment dynamics in the river can be described by the three same processes than on the land:
erosion, deposition and transport. The diﬀerence is that channel ﬂow is much higher, deeper
and permanent compared to overland ﬂow. In channels, erosion is the direct removal of sediments
from the river bed or bank (lateral erosion). Sediments are transported in the river either by
rolling, sliding and silting (bed load transport) or via turbulent flow in the higher water column
(suspended load transport). The type of transport is determined by the river bed shear stress.
As sediment particles have a higher density than water, they can also be deposited on the river bed
according to their settling velocity compared to ﬂow velocity. In addition to regular deposition in
the river, lakes, reservoirs and ﬂoodplains represents additional major sediment settling pools.

Complete models of sediment dynamics based on hydrology and not hydraulic or hydrodynamic are much
rarer than for soil loss and inland dynamics. The simpler models such as the SWAT default sediment
river model uses again the transport capacity of the ﬂow to determine if there is erosion or deposition
(Neitsch et al., 2011).  A more physics-based approach (Partheniades, 1965) to determine river erosion
is used by Liu et al. (2018) and in the new SWAT’s approach developed by Narasimhan et al. (2017). For
wﬂow_sediment, the new physics-based model of SWAT was chosen for transport and erosion as it enables
the use of parameter estimation for erosion of bed and bank of the channel and separates the suspended
from the bed loads.

Running the river model is an option of the wflow\_sediment model and is enabled using the TOML file:
```toml
[model]
runrivermodel = true
```

### Sediment inputs in a river cell
The first part of the river model assesses how much detached sediment
are in the river cell at the beginning of the timestep t. Sources of
detached sediment are sediments coming from land erosion, estimated with
the soil loss part of wflow_sediment model, the sediment coming from
upstream river cells and the detached sediment that were left in the
cell at the end of the previous timestep (t-1):
```math 
   (sed_{in})_{t} = (sed_{land})_{t} + upstream\left[(sed_{out})_{t-1}\right] + (sed_{riv})_{t-1}
```

### River transport and erosion
Once the amount of sediment inputs at the beginning of the timestep is
known, the model then estimates transport, and river erosion if there is
a deficit of sediments. Transport in the river system is estimated via a
transport capacity formula. There are several transport capacity
formulas available in wflow_sediment, some requiring calibration and
some not. Choosing a transport capacity equation depends on the river
characteristics (some equation are more suited for narrow or wider
rivers), and on the reliability of the required
river parameters (such as slope, width or mean particle diameter of the
river channel). Several river transport caapcity are available and
the choice is set up in the model section of the TOML:
```toml
[model]
rivtransportmethod = "bagnold" # River flow transport capacity method: ["bagnold", "engelund", "yang", "kodatie", "molinas"]
```

**Simplified Bagnold**

Originally more valid for intermediate to
large rivers, this simplified version of the Bagnold equation relates
sediment transport to flow velocity with two simple calibration
parameters (Neitsch et al, 2011):
```math 
C_{max} = c_{sp} * \left( \dfrac{prf * Q}{h * W} \right) ^{sp_{exp}}
```
where ``C_{max}`` is the sediment concentration (ton
m``^{-3}`` or kg/L), ``Q`` is the surface runoff in the
river cell (m``^{3}``/s), ``h`` is the river water level (m),
``W`` is the river width (m) and ``c_{sp}``, ``prf`` and
``sp_{exp}`` are calibration parameters. The ``prf``
coefficient is usually used to deduce the peak velocity of the flow,
but for simplification in wflow_sediment, the equation was simplified
to only get two parameters to calibrate: ``sp_{exp}`` and
``c_{Bagnold} = c_{sp} * prf^{sp_{exp}}``. The coefficient
``sp_{exp}`` usually varies between 1 and 2 while ``prf`` and
``c_{sp}`` have a wider range of variation. The table below 
summarizes ranges and values of the three Bagnold
coefficients used by other studies:

Table: Range of the simplified Bagnold coefficients (and calibrated value)

| Study River | ``prf`` range | ``c_{sp}`` range | ``sp_{exp}`` range |
|:----------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Vigiak 2015 | Danube | 0.5-2 (/) | 0.0001-0.01 (0.003-0.006) | 1-2 (1.4) |
| Vigiak 2017 | Danube | / | 0.0001-0.01 (0.0015) | 1-2 (1.4) |
| Abbaspour 2007 | Thur (CH) | 0.2-0.25 (/) | 0.001-0.002 (/) | 0.35-1.47 (/) |
| Oeurng 2011 | Save (FR) | 0-2 (0.58) | 0.0001-0.01 (0.01) | 1-2 (2) |

**Engelund and Hansen**
This transport capacity is not present in SWAT but used in many models
such as Delft3D-WAQ, Engelund and Hansen calculates the total sediment
load as (Engelund and Hansen, 1967):
```math 
   C_{w} = 0.05 \left( \dfrac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{s} - \rho} \right) \left( \dfrac{u * S}{\sqrt{\left( \dfrac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{s} - \rho} \right) * g * D_{50}}} \right) \theta^{1/2}
```
where ``C_{w}`` is the sediment concentration by weight,
``\rho`` and ``\rho_{s}`` are the fluid and sediment density
(here equal to 1000 and 2650 g m``^{-3}``), ``u`` is the water
mean velocity (m/s), ``S`` is the river slope, ``g`` is the
acceleration due to gravity, ``D_{50}`` is the river mean diameter
(m) and ``\theta`` is the Shields parameter.

**Kodatie**
Kodatie (1999) developped the power relationships from
Posada (1995) using field data and linear optimization so that they
would be applicable for a wider range of riverbed sediment size. The
resulting equation, for a rectangular channel, is (Neitsch et al, 2011):
```math 
   C_{max} = \left( \dfrac{a* u^{b}* h^{c} * S^{d}}{V_{in}} \right) * W
```
where ``V_{in}`` in the volume of water entering the river cell  
during the timestep (m``^{3}``) and ``a``, ``b``, ``c``
and ``d`` are coefficients depending on the riverbed sediment size.
Values of these coefficients are summarized in the table below.

Table: Range of the simplified Bagnold coefficients (and calibrated value)

| River sediment diameter | a | b | c | d |
|:----------- | --------- | - | - | - | - |
| ``D_{50} \leq`` 0.05mm | 281.4 | 2.622 | 0.182 | 0 |
| 0.05 ``< D_{50} \leq`` 0.25mm | 2 829.6 | 3.646 | 0.406 | 0.412 |
| 0.25 ``< D_{50} \leq`` 2mm | 2 123.4 | 3.300 | 0.468 | 0.613 |
| ``D_{50} >`` 2mm | 431 884.8 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 2.000 |

**Yang**
Yang (1996) developed a set of two equations giving transport
of sediments for sand-bed or gravel-bed rivers. The sand equation
(``D_{50} < 2mm``) is:
```math 
   log\left(C_{ppm}\right) = 5.435 - 0.286log\frac{\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\nu}-0.457log\frac{u_{*}}{\omega_{s,50}} \\
   +\left(1.799-0.409log\frac{\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\nu}-0.314log\frac{u_{*}}{\omega_{s,50}}\right)log\left(\frac{uS}{\omega_{s,50}}-\frac{u_{cr}S}{\omega_{s,50}}\right)
```
And the gravel equation (``2 \leq D_{50} < 10 mm``) is:
```math 
   log\left(C_{ppm}\right) = 6.681 - 0.633log\frac{\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\nu}-4.816log\frac{u_{*}}{\omega_{s,50}} \\
   +\left(2.784-0.305log\frac{\omega_{s,50}D_{50}}{\nu}-0.282log\frac{u_{*}}{\omega_{s,50}}\right)log\left(\frac{uS}{\omega_{s,50}}-\frac{u_{cr}S}{\omega_{s,50}}\right)
```
where ``C_{ppm}`` is sediment concentration in parts per million by
weight, ``\omega_{s,50}`` is the settling velocity of a particle
with the median riverbed diameter estimated with Stokes (m/s),
``\nu`` is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m``^{2}``/s),
``u_{*}`` is the shear velocity (``\sqrt{gR_{H}S}`` in m/s with
``R_{H}`` the hydraulic radius of the river) and ``u_{cr}`` is
the critical velocity (m/s, equation can be found in Hessel, 2007).

**Molinas and Wu**
The Molinas and Wu (2001) transport equation was
developed for large sand-bed rivers based on the universal stream power
``\psi``. The corresponding equation is (Neitsch et al, 2011):
```math 
   C_{w} = \dfrac{1430*(0.86+\sqrt{\psi})* \psi^{1.5}}{0.016+\psi}* 10^{-6}
```
where ``\psi`` is the universal stream power given by:
```math 
   \psi = \dfrac{\psi^{3}}{\left(\dfrac{\rho_{s}}{\rho}-1\right)* g* h* \omega_{s,50} * \left[ log_{10}\left(\dfrac{h}{D_{50}}\right)\right]^{2}}
```

Once the maximum concentration ``C_{max}`` is established with one
of the above transport formula, the model then determines if there is
erosion of the river bed and bank. In order to do that, the difference
``sed_{ex}`` between the maximum amount of sediment estimated with
transport (``sed_{max} = C_{max}* V_{in}``) and the sediment
inputs to the river cell (``sed_{in}`` calculated above) is
calculated. If too much sediment is coming in and ``sed_{ex}`` is
negative, then there is no river bed and bank erosion. And if the river
has not reach its maximum transport capacity, then erosion of the river
happens.

First, the sediments stored in the cell from deposition in previous
timesteps ``sed_{stor}`` are eroded from clay to gravel. If this
amount is not enough to cover ``sed_{ex}``, then erosion of the
local river bed and bank material starts.

Instead of just setting river erosion amount to just cover the remaining
difference ``sed_{exeff}`` between ``sed_{ex}`` and
``sed_{stor}``, actual erosion potential is adjusted using river
characteristics and is separated between the bed and bank of the river
using the physics-based approach of Knight (1984).

The bed and bank of the river are
supposed to only be able to erode a maximum amount of their material
``E_{R,bed}`` for the bed and ``E_{R,bank}`` for the river bank.
For a rectangular channel, assuming it is meandering and thus only one
bank is prone to erosion, they are calculated from the equations(Neitsch et al, 2011):
```math 
   E_{R,bed} = k_{d,bed} * \left( \tau_{e,bed} - \tau_{cr,bed} \right)* 10^{-6} * L * W * \rho_{b, bed} * \Delta t
   E_{R,bank} = k_{d,bank} * \left( \tau_{e,bank} - \tau_{cr,bank} \right)* 10^{-6} * L * h * \rho_{b, bank} * \Delta t
```
where ``E_{R}`` is the potential bed/bank erosion rates (tons),
``k_{d}`` is the erodibility of the bed/bank material
(cm``^{3}`` N``^{-1}`` s``^{-1}``), ``\tau_{e}`` is
the effective shear stress from the flow on the bed/bank
(N/m``^{2}``), ``\tau_{cr}`` is the critical shear stress for
erosion to happen (N/m``^{2}``), ``L``, ``W`` and ``h``
are the channel length, width and water height (m), ``\rho_{b}`` is
the bulk density of the bed/bank of the river (g/cm``^{3}``) and
``\Delta t`` is the model timestep (s).

In wflow_sediment, the erodibility of the bed/bank are approximated
using the formula from Hanson and Simon (2001):
```math 
   k_{d}=0.2* \tau_{cr}^{-0.5}
```
Normally erodibilities are evaluated using jet test in the field and
there are several reviews and some adjustments possible to this equation
(Simon et al, 2011). However, to avoid too heavy calibration
and for the scale considered, this equation is supposed to be efficient
enough. The critical shear stress ``\tau_{cr}`` is evaluated
differently for the bed and bank. For the bed, the most common formula
from Shields initiation of movement is used. For the bank, a more recent
approach from Julian and Torres (2006) is used :
```math 
   \tau_{cr,bank} = (0.1+0.1779* SC+0.0028* SC^{2}-2.34* 10^{-5} * SC^{3})*C_{ch}
```
where ``SC`` is the percent clay and silt content of the river bank
and ``C_{ch}`` is a coefficient taking into account the positive
impact of vegetation on erosion reduction. This coefficient is then
dependent on the land use and classical values are shown in the table below. 
These values where then adapted for use with the
GlobCover land use map. Percent of clay and silt (along with sand and
gravel) for the channel is estimated from the river median particle
diameter assuming the same values as SWAT shown in the table below.
Median particle diameter is here estimated depending on the Strahler
river order. The higher the order, the smaller the diameter is. As the
median diameter is only used in wflow_sediment for the estimation of the
river bed/bank sediment composition, this supposition should be enough.
Actual refined data or calibration may however be needed if the median
diameter is also required for the transport formula. In a similar way,
the bulk densities of river bed and bank are also just assumed to be of
respectively 1.5 and 1.4 g/cm``^{3}``.

Table: Classical values of the channel cover vegetation coefficent (Julian and Torres, 2006)

| Bank vegetation | ``C_{ch}`` |
|:--------------- | ---------- |
| None | 1.00 |
| Grassy | 1.97 |
| Sparse trees | 5.40 |
| Dense trees | 19.20 |

Table : Composition of the river bed/bank depending on the median diameter ``d_{50}`` [``\mu``m] (Neitsch et al, 2011) 

|Sediment Fraction   | ``\leq`` 5 | 5 to 50 | 50 to 2000 | ``>``2000 |
|:-------------   -- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Sand | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.65 | 0.15 |
| Silt | 0.15 | 0.65 | 0.15 | 0.15 |
| Clay | 0.65 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.05 |
| Gravel | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.65 |

Then, the repartition of the flow shear stress is refined into the
effective shear stress and the bed and bank of the river using the
equations developed by Knight (1984) for a rectangular channel:
```math 
   \tau_{e,bed} = \rho g R_{H} S * \left(1 - \dfrac{SF_{bank}}{100}\right) * \left(1+\dfrac{2h}{W}\right)
   \tau_{e,bank} = \rho g R_{H} S * \left( SF_{bank}\right) * \left(1+\dfrac{W}{2h}\right)
```
where ``\rho g`` is the fluid specific weight (9800
N/m``^{3}`` for water), ``R_{H}`` is the hydraulic radius of
the channel (m), ``h`` and ``W`` are the water level and river
width (m). ``SF_{bank}`` is the proportion of shear stress acting on
the bank (%) and is estimated from (Knight, 1984):
```math 
   SF_{bank} = exp \left( -3.230* log_{10}\left(\dfrac{W}{h}+3\right)+6.146 \right)
```
Finally the relative erosion potential of the bank and bed of the river
is calculated by:
```math 
   RTE_{bed} = \dfrac{E_{R,bed}}{E_{R,bed}+E_{R,bank}}
   RTE_{bank} = 1 - RTE_{bed}
```
And the final actual eroded amount for the bed and bank is the maximum
between ``RTE * sed_{exeff}`` and the erosion potential
``E_{R}``. Total eroded amount of sediment ``sed_{erod}`` is
then the sum of the eroded sediment coming from the storage of
previously deposited sediment and the river bed/bank erosion.

### River deposition

As sediments have a higher density than water, moving sediments in water
can be deposited in the river bed. The deposition process depends on the
mass of the sediment, but also on flow characteristics such as velocity.
In wflow_sediment, as in SWAT, deposition is modelled with Einstein’s
equation (Neitsch et al, 2011):
```math 
   P_{dep}=\left(1-\dfrac{1}{e^{x}}\right)* 100
```
where ``P_{dep}`` is the percentage of sediments that is deposited
on the river bed and x is a parameter calculated with:
```math 
   x = \dfrac{1.055* L * \omega_{s}}{u* h}
```
where ``L`` and ``h`` are channel length and water height (m),
``\omega_{s}`` is the particle settling velocity calculated with
Stokes formula (m/s) and ``u`` is the mean flow velocity (m/s). The
calculated percentage is then subtracted from the amount of sediment
input and eroded river sediment for each particle size class
(``sed_{dep} = P_{dep}/100 * (sed_{in} + sed_{erod})``).
Resulting deposited sediment are then stored in the river bed and can be
re-mobilized in future time steps by erosion.

### Mass balance and sediment concentration

Finally after estimating inputs, deposition and erosion with the
transport capacity of the flow, the amount of sediment actually leaving
the river cell to go downstream is estimated using:
```math 
   sed_{out} = (sed_{in} + sed_{erod} - sed_{dep}) * \dfrac{V_{out}}{V}
```
where ``sed_{out}`` is the amount of sediment leaving the river cell
(tons), ``sed_{in}`` is the amount of sediment coming into the river
cell (storage from previous timestep, land erosion and sediment flux
from upstream river cells in tons), ``sed_{erod}`` is the amount of
sediment coming from river erosion (tons), ``sed_{dep}`` is the
amount of deposited sediments (tons), ``V_{out}`` is the volume of
water leaving the river cell (surface runoff ``Q`` times timestep
``\Delta t`` in m``^{3}``) and ``V`` is the total volume
of water in the river cell (``V_{out}`` plus storage
``h* W * L`` in m``^{3}``).

A mass balance is then used to calculate the amount of sediment
remaining in the cell at the end of the timestep
``(sed_{riv})_{t}``:
```math 
   (sed_{riv})_{t} = (sed_{riv})_{t-1} + (sed_{land})_{t} + upstream\left[(sed_{out})_{t-1}\right] + (sed_{erod})_{t} - (sed_{dep})_{t} - (sed_{out})_{t}
```

### Lake and reservoir modelling
Apart from land and river, the hydrologic wflow_sbm model also handles
lakes and reservoirs modelling. In wflow_sbm, lakes and large reservoirs
are modelled using a 1D bucket model at the cell corresponding to the
outlet. For the other cells belonging to the lake/reservoir which are
not the outlet, processes such as precipitation and evaporation are
filtered out and shifted to the outlet cell. wflow_sediment then handles
the lakes in the same way. If a cell belongs to a lake/reservoir and is
not the outlet then the model assumes that no erosion/deposition of
sediments is happening and the sediments are only all transported to the
lake/reservoir outlet. Once the sediments reach the outlet, then
sediments are deposited in the lake/reservoir according to Camp’s model
(1945) (Verstraeten et al, 2000):
```math 
   TE = \dfrac{\omega_{s}}{u_{cr,res}} = \dfrac{A_{res}}{Q_{out,res}} * \omega_{s}
```
where ``TE`` is the trapping efficiency of the lake/reservoir (or
the fraction of particles trapped), ``\omega_{s}`` is the particle
velocity from Stokes (m/s), ``u_{cr,res}`` is the reservoir’s
critical settling velocity (m/s) which is equal to the reservoir’s
outflow ``Q_{out,res}`` (m``^{3}``/s) divided by the reservoir’s
surface area ``A_{res}`` (m``^{2}``).

Lake and reservoir modelling is enabled in the model section of the TOML and require the
extra following input arguments:
```toml
[model]
doreservoir = true
dolake = false

[input.vertical]
# Reservoir
resareas = "wflow_reservoirareas"
# Lake
lakeareas = "wflow_lakeareas"

[input.lateral.river]
# Reservoir
resarea = "ResSimpleArea"
resareas = "wflow_reservoirareas"
reslocs = "wflow_reservoirlocs"
# Lake
lakearea = "LakeArea"
lakeareas = "wflow_lakeareas"
lakelocs = "wflow_lakelocs"
```
Note that in the inland part, lake and reservoir coverage are used to filter erosion and transport
in overland flow.
